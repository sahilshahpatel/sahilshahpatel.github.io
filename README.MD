# My Personal Website
Welcome to my personal website! This is the source code repository, which you can feel free to look through. I am currently using Astro's static site builder, but in the past I have used PostHTML as well as a vanilla stack. I like to try out new stacks every once in a while if they feel like a significant improvement over what I had before, so I'm sure I'll be on to the next hot framework in a few years.

You can check out the live website (hosted with GithubPages) at [https://sahilshahpatel.com](https://sahilshahpatel.com).
