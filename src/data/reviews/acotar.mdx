# Review in Summary
A Court of Thorns and Roses earns a B- for me. The romantic and fantasy elements of the story are passable at worst and pretty good at best. The B grade mostly comes from character motivations bending over easily to the whim of the plot, which often felt forced. Personally I would have liked a more fleshed out fantasy world, and the type of romantic story told isn't tailored for me, earning the minus grade.

# Full Review
This review contains spoilers! (I also listened to this book so please excuse the typos. Feyra is definitely the superior spelling though)

This was my first full-romance novel that I've read (which I can remember), so that certainly affected my opinion of the novel. Having never read romance, I thought romantasy would be great place to start since I do enjoy fantasy quite a bit. I was encouraged to try this series by a few different groups of people, and when it was chosen for my book club I finally decided to give it a chance.

Starting out I was surprised by how much of a caricature Feyre's family is. In this "Cinderella" phase of the story, her sisters and father are just so cruel. Maas seems to try and give them some reasons for why they are so useless, but the "downsides" so unbalance the "upsides" that they just come across as horrible people using weaponized incompetence at best.

Once Feyre gets to Prythian the story gets somewhat better. The plot meanders as it desparately tries to justify her presence there\* and why she doesn't just run away. (\*this is justified better once you learn the twist near the end, but it felt pretty random to me while reading). Once she meets the suriel, though, the story picks up.

From there I quite enjoyed the story during her time in Prythian. This section of the book (which is about half of it, perhaps) is what gives it enough positive marks to earn a B. The romance is not my favorite type, but it's decently well done.

When she returns to the human realm I am again reminded of how little I cared for her family. Nesta's "redemption" is not earned and not really necessary either. This was easily the most boring part of the book.

Feyre then returns to Prythian for the final act. This section is much better than the human realm chapters just before it, but it also contains the majority of the marks against this book which are all wrapped up in one character: Amarantha. She actually has a relatively interesting backstory. My first impression wasn't great because it felt a little romance-forced, but I soon reconsidered because I think that's just part of the genre and has to just be accepted. The real trouble starts when you analyze any of her decision making with Feyre in this final act and how it clashes with her supposed motivations.

The actions scenes in this final act were quite well done. The bits between challenges were pretty interesting too (with some extra forced romance-y topics as well). The final riddle was a little silly and I called the answer from the moment I heard it, but that didn't ruin the moment.

And that's the novel! As you can see I had my ups and downs with it. While it's not my type of story, I can see the appeal and even think some sections are A tier. Most of it is B tier with a few arbitrary-feeling moments plot inconsistencies that knocked it down a peg as well.

# Extra Thoughts
## My problem with Amarantha
Ok, her backstory is actually not bad. Her sister had a human lover who betrayed her exactly as Amarantha expected, and that created a burning hatred for humanity and a fundamental belief that human "love" is not real and is necessarily performative and self-serving. Great. Solid backstory for a villain who must be opposed to a human-faerie couple.

The second part of her backstory is that she is in love with Tamlin. Or maybe she justs lusts after him -- she doesn't really ever do anything indicating real love. Either way, it feels quite odd to me that she would still want him after all this time; that she would still care so much as to go through all of this. But it's a romance novel so I suppose it might just be par for the course.

So she curses Tamlin such that he must understand her hatred of humanity. He can only break the curse if a human who hates faeries comes to love him, a change of heart so impossible that it will explain to Tamlin why Amarantha herself cannot have a similar change of heart.

And now enters our heroine, willing to brave the mountain of Amarantha to prove her love. Amarantha sees her and laughs. That's weird because the whole point of her curse is that Feyre is an impossibility. But ok, maybe she just thinks Feyre is faking it for self interest. Amarantha's only motivations from here are either 1) she doesn't care because Feyre is insiginificant to her or 2) she must prove to Tamlin that Feyre's love is not true. Option 1 is obviously not great story-wise, so option 2 is all that's left.

But what about the three trials has anything to do with that core motivation? Feyre has to undergo some tough things which could in principle prove her love. But also she is trapped in the mountain and will die if she doesn't go through with these trials. So her persistence does not in any way prove whether her love is selfless or selfish.

The final trial is the one that should really do it. So Maas wants you to think, if Feyre really cared about Tamlin she would know that he has a stone heart. But that idea falls to pieces when you realize that the action Feyre should take is _exactly the same_ whether her love is true or not. If she truly loves Tamlin she knows he has a stone heart and that stabbing him is not killing him. If she is actually selfish then she has just wanted to survive this whole time (not sure why she showed up in the first place but whatever), and so she will win the final trial and guarantee her saftey if she stabs Tamlin. Either way she stabs Tamlin, and so Amarantha's trials do nothing to prove her point.

And finally lets get to the riddle. The riddle actually makes sense in principle. By having love be the answer, Amarantha is basically saying that humans aren't capable of that kind of love and so won't recognize it in the riddle. This works for the most part, but I do have two problems with it. First, she acknowledges that humans are good at mimicing love even if she believes they don't truly feel it. But this doesn't proclude them from _understanding_ love and thus being able to solve the riddle without actually feeling love itself.

Second, Maas doesn't write the moment when Feyre solves the riddle particularly well, given the motivation Amarantha should have. There was some of Feyre thinking back on her journey with Tamlin, but I wanted more. And I especially wanted more from Amarantha on how surprising it is that Feyre solved it and actually proved that she understood love.

## A comparison to Beauty and the Beast
I really love Beauty and the Beast. Not necessarily from an analytical lense (as I haven't heard the original tale or rewatched the Disney classic recently), but from a nostalgic perspective, Belle was always my favorite Disney princess. I've seen a couple retellings of the story, including _Belle_ the Japanese anime move (which I should write a full review of soon). I didn't go into this story knowing it was at all similar, so it was a bit of a surprise! It's certainly not a retelling of the original, but I would say it's inspired by it. So I want to go through a short comparison...

In Beauty and the Beast, the main parable is as follows: the prince used to be ugly on the inside but beautiful on the outside. Along came a witch to curse him such that his exterior was as wicked as his interior. This curse was meant to develop his empathy, and by the time Belle meets him he is now kind on the inside and ugly on the outside. Meanwhile Belle is our protagonist because of her outlook. She is the ultimate optimist -- she isn't stupid or stilly, but she always sees the best in people and doesn't allow their appearance to affect her perception of them.

In this story inspired by Beauty and the Beast, Tamlin is superficially the Beast, but he doesn't really play the same role. Feyre also doesn't play the role of Belle very well, because she is _not_ an optimist. She doesn't see the best in Tamlin at all. ACOTAR actually swaps the gender roles -- for Feyre and Tamlin to fall in love, Feyre needs to be the one to change (she must overcome her prejudice), while Tamlin can be our role model who is always just and kind and simply waits for Feyre to see that truth.

I think that's actually pretty interesting. Belle is this perfect character that we are meant to aspire to be like, while Feyre is more similar to us as the reader and her journey is meant to show us that the same is possible for us too.

The story sets itself up for this great theme, and even has a secret Act 3 with Amarantha that _also_ works well with this theme. What I don't love is that this theme isn't very well developed throughout the story. Feyre doesn't actually seem to hate faeries all that much. She pretty quickly moves from "hatred" to "distrust" and is all over how beautiful the grounds are and how handsome her captor is from the outset. This makes her transition much less of a real transition. Meanwhile Tamlin doesn't really try to explain why she shouldn't hate faeries. There is some of this with the history of the war and Tamlin's opinion on human slaves, but it doesn't go as far or make as much of a point out of it as I would like. And finally Amarantha is viewed more as a universal evil than as a representation of this hatred between peoples. A story which is more focused on a theme and constructed around it would have made Amarantha embody the theme by representing all those who loath humans and by being defeated through love. The story sort of hits the second half, but even that not really, and it's certainly not emphasized as a thematic moment.
