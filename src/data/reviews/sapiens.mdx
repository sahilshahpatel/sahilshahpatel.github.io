# Quick Preview
Sapiens is an introspective look at human history and what it can tells about who we are, how we work, and where we're going. Despite being quite dense, it is written in a style that makes it both digestible and just plain interesting.

# Full Review
I first heard of Sapiens when I my parents read it in their book club during the peak of its popularity. It piqued my interest as a concept, but I don't typically enjoy long form nonfiction writing, so I didn't try it then. Fast forward a few years and my own book club selected Sapiens. One of the things I love about my book club now is that it pushes me to read things I probably wouldn't otherwise, so this time I picked the book up.

I thought Sapiens was going to be like a textbook -- cold, hard history though perhaps told in a more entertaining fashion. The truth is it is much more like an essay. The main content of the book are opinions that Harari has, though they are supported by historical facts.

I give this book an A because it was surprisingly fun to read and was certainly thought provoking. Had I been the type to read lots of this kind of thing, I could see it being an S. For me, it didn't reach that level, but it's an easy recommend and certainly deserve the A.

# My favorite of Harari's ideas
Let's go through some of the biggest ideas from the book and what I thought of them.

## Shared fictions
Harari's first big idea is that what separates _homo sapiens_ from other humans is our ability to create shared myths. These allow us to collaborate effectively in much larger groups than other species.

I, for one, love this idea. I've always been a believer in the power of story telling, and also a believer that so much of our world is built off of collective trust. Harari doesn't provide much proof that this is true (as that would be pretty hard to do), but it seems very plausible and is a fascinating notion.

## The Agricultural Revolution was bad for individuals
With this idea, Harari is questioning the basic premise that all of these revolutions in human history were forward progress to a better life. The Agricultural Revolution, for example, let us support more human life with less land, but actually required a lot more work and gave us a lot less healthy of a diet.

Again, I love this. I am always cautious about the idea that growth is the same as progress. Harari explains that agriculture grew because of memetic factors and not because individuals were actually having their life improved. This is a line of thinking that I think many people don't go down, but we probably should all consider.

## The European mindset
Harari asks an interesting question: how did a relatively unimportant corner of the world quickly come to dominate it? His answer is that the European culture allowed one to admit they did not know something, and this fostered curiosity and supported scientific inquiry and technological development.

I'm not sure how I feel about this. Having be raised in a Western culture myself, it's hard to imagine people being so self assured, and especially hard to imagine them having no curiosity for the world around them. I would have loved more discussion about why other cultures did not work this way and more facts to back that up. Examples like gunpowder were interesting, but not enough for me.

## The future of humanity
Harari ends the book with wildly speculative takes on the future of humanity, specifically with reference to biotech and computer technology.

I don't think anything he says here is factually incorrect, but I did find it odd how it's written with the same certainty and persuasive style as the rest despite the fact that it is extrapolating into the future based on very little data. Harari himself admits that this era of human history is very young, and so it's hard to make predictions, but then he goes off and does just that. Personally I found that a bit annoying. It felt like he had random opinions and speculations of his own that he wanted to share and just slapped them on to the end of the book. The ending reads like an opinion piece whereas the rest is much closer to an essay.
