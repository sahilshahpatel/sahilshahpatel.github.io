Note: This review is being written after watching a 10th anniversary IMAX showing. This was not my first watch.

I love this movie so much! Christopher Nolan with Hanz Zimmer is really a combo for the ages. Interstellar nails all of the vibes, the atmosphere, and the emotion that its trying to create.

I don't need to heap on the praise, so instead I want to address a few common points and some things that changed for me on this watch.

First, I really do not mind the ending. I get it -- it's a fairly scientific movie that goes off the sci-fi deep end in its final minutes in a way that feels unsatisfying to some. For me, though, Interstellar is an emotional story, not a technological one. And the emotion it's going for is extremely well served by the wacky science at the end. So no points at all taken away by me for the end. In fact, I think it adds to why I love it so much.

Second, there is criticism that the son's character is useless or irrelevant. I completely disagree. The focus is on Murph, and that's clear. But her brother serves an important purpose in the story. Interstellar praises the curious and pioneering disposition of both Murph and her dad. However, it doesn't condemn regular people who want to live regular lives. This is contrasted with people like the teacher and the son's wife who would ignore knowledge in front of them to better suit their own purposes. When Murph refuses to make videos for her dad, her brother continuing to do so is important for contrast as well. He also fuels our emotion by both giving his own story and delaying the arrival of Murph's. I do agree that I would have liked some mention of him at the very end when he sees Murph. Perhaps some closure on the idea of him coming to terms with his son's different desires in life.

Ok now let's discuss some things that changed for me in this last watch, starting with the infamous "love monologue". I used to say that I didn't mind it because in my head it was tied up with the ending. But rewatching it I realized that that happens much earlier than I remembered. I do think it's a bit out of place, and doesn't really come full circle all that well. He does mention love while in the tesseract, but I found the connection to Dr. Brand's monologue unclear.

I also found more plot holes on this last watch:
• How do they just jet off of these planets when they needed a giant multi-stage rocket to get off Earth? Some planets have more gravity than Earth and some less, but they just fly off of all of them in Star Wars-like ships
• Did these astrophysicists really not consider the time dilation of the message from the water planet? It works great for the plot but they really should have thought about it
• The one astronaut gets left on the ship for decades and we like barely address it at all! He is even showed to have being in space getting to him before they abandon him. In what world does he not go insane?

Really, though, none of these are that important to me at all. The core emotional story of Interstellar is just so strong, and its so well aided by the soundtrack that minor plot conveniences don't really take away from the impact of the movie in the end.

Interstellar has been on my favorite movies list since I first saw it. I have an emotional reaction to just thinking about certain scenes, or just hearing the music. It has certainly left an impact on my life, and easily earns it's spot in S+ tier.
