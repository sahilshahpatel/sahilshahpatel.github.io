I remember liking Shaun of the Dead when I watched in in high school probably, so when I learned that there is a set of movies just like it, I was curious. Hot Fuzz is the first I watched, and it was quite good.

Silly humor usually isn't my vibe, and while there were certain jokes I didn't like, on the whole I was laughing a lot! I think the silliness being used to poke fun at British society (rather than being silly for its own sake) helped a lot.

I was quite surprised that the movie had a somewhat societal take. From what I remember Shaun of the Dead is mostly surface level with some satire around regular people already being zombies in life and some themes about friendship. Hot Fuzz also has the friendship theme, but the theme of an older generation of people being so obsessed with their image and being fearful of young culture can't be ignored for its political message.

That being said, this movie isn't trying to push anything too hard. It's certainly not generally political. Mostly it's making fairly obvious observations about our society, but making you actually consider them by turning up the absurdity.

Overall I really liked this movie, even more than I expected. It was both funny and gave me something to think about -- what more can I ask for!
