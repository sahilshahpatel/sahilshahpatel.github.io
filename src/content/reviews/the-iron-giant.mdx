I was really looking forward to watching *The Iron Giant* because I'd heard such great things about it. Ultimately, it felt exactly like [*The Wild Robot*](the-wild-robot) in that it's a great outline for a movie, but fails to make you really care about the characters and the story.

What do I mean by that? Well I can't point to exactly what's missing, but I know that the result of what's missing is that when I reach each plot point I intellectually understand how I'm supposed to feel, and I even might cry when I'm supposed to because of the visuals or music or whatever, but I don't really feel the depth of emotion that I know I *could* based on the story. And the only reason why that makes sense is that I don't care enough.

Hogarth, Annie, and Dean all feel unremarkable to me. While they make sense as archetypes, I just didn't find myself caring about them as individuals that much. I think the main problem is Hogarth himself who really needs to tie all the characters together. While we're told that he's an outcast, I don't think that point is made very well. Perhaps in a "show don't tell" kind of way. As I'm writing this I'm reminded of [*Lilo and Stitch*](lilo-and-stitch) which did a much better job of making Lilo feel like an outcast even though it's not a super deep or subtle story either.

Really, *The Iron Giant* is not a bad movie at all, but I just don't think it's a good one either. There are a lot of movies which deal with the same themes but do it much better. For a child, the lack of depth and connection probably doesn't take a lot away from the film. But for an adult it does, and that's what Disney and Pixar were always so good at that I think was missing in this film.
