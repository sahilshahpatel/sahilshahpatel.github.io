I loved Adrienne Young's writing in [The Unmaking of June Farrow](june-farrow), and afterwards I went through her catalog to find other books to read. Of what she'd written at the time, only Spells for Forgetting jumped out at me (the others were YA it seemed). I put this book on my list for a while, and finally I picked it for book club hoping to introduce her as an author to my friends!

But that introduction didn't go as planned. I quite enjoyed Spells for Forgetting (though not as much as June Farrow), but my friends did not agree. In our discussion I came to see a lot of the problems with the book, even though they didn't change my overall opinion. Later I talked to a friend who had just finished June Farrow but had not read Spells for Forgetting, and she had some critiques that I again didn't disagree with, and yet didn't affect my view overall yet again.

I don't usually feel that I have blind spots with books. Usually I can criticize things even if I like them, and I am conscious of the fact that I am enjoying this thing despite certain flaws. But with both of Young's books I loved the experience of reading them so much, and I really didn't have many critiques until talking to others about it.

In the end, my rating is always subjective. And because I loved both books after reading them, my rating is going to be high. I'll start out with what I loved, then talk about the critiques I heard, and finish up with why this is an A- and not an A or A+.

# What I Loved
Young's writing voice is just amazing to me. I love how descriptive and poetic it can be without feeling over-the-top or distracting from the story at hand. I love how well she can set an atmosphere. The quietly creepy, the unknown, the mystical -- when I'm in those moments of her novels I feel it in my bones! The remote Pacific Northwest setting really matches the vibe, in some ways reminding me of [Remarkably Bright Creatures](remarkably-bright-creatures). There's a reason why Young's first two adult novels take place in a small town, and it's because she is really good at capturing that environment.

I love her brand of magical realism ("peripheral magic" as she calls it). I think both hard and soft magic systems are great for different stories. But I hate a magic system that's semi-explained or quantified without explanation (_cough_ [Iron Widow](iron-widow), [ACOTAR](acotar) _cough_). Young's peripheral magic is just explored enough to be intriguing without being explained enough to require details and concreteness. It serves the plot yes, but not in contrived ways -- usually it's quite well set up and new magic isn't just invented for the sake of a story moment she wanted.

And what really hooks me about her books is her mysteries. Young is very good at dropping breadcrumbs and having them come together in a dramatically satisfying way. In Spells for Forgetting the mystery does have some big plot holes which I'll discuss in the next section, but even those didn't take me out of the mystery fully. I still found myself unsure of what had happened and wanting to know.

The last part I'll mention is her characters. A lot of my friends complained about a lack of personality in them, and I kind of see where they are coming from. And yet I love the characters! I have yet to figure out how to articulate why though. The closest I've gotten is that it feels almost like a video game. Often in video games the player character doesn't have intrinsic personality, and that makes sense because the player gets to inject personality based on their choices. Young's characters don't often have obvious personalities (partially because they are purposefully bland, small-town 30 year olds), but their past and their struggles make me empathize with them, and their choices inform me about what type of person they are.

# The Critiques (SPOILERS)
Many of the critiques brought up at book club were just preferences. I love Young's writing voice and others didn't. I like her characters and others didn't. But some were not, and this section is reserved for those.

The biggest complaint was that Emery is dumb. She is surprised that Lily didn't tell her everything, but it feels fairly obvious that there is some deception going on there. Yes that's dramatic irony, but it's also a product of the fact that we get a lot of setup proving August and Emery were close when they were young, but not that much setup showing that Lily and Emery were truly best friends. Worst of all, Emery is way too scared about this letter getting out. Honestly I was pretty fine with that in the context of a small town where Emery doesn't want to draw more attention to herself. But why is she scared of it getting to the Seattle police? The letter is suggestive but it doesn't prove much and August would definitely be able to make a defense. The fact that the end hinges on them being scared of the letter feels a little convenient.

The other townspeople are perhaps even more stupid. It is just obvious that Lily died from magic. She drowned but her clothes weren't wet. She had wax on her clothes. This just screams magic. So why does Jake not consider that? Boys can't do magic apparently, so why would August be the prime suspect? Even worse, it is said that the Blackwoods are the only family who kept records of dark magic in addition to "regular" magic. So when a girl dies on the same day that someone breaks into the house where said dark magic is kept, no one bats an eye? Perhaps Leoda convinced people to keep this under wraps, but then Emery or Albertine should have figured it out. And the rest of the council did not seem to know that Lily was trying to kill Emery, and I don't see how Leoda would have been able to keep that secret while also telling them not to consider magic as a murder weapon.

The one complaint I felt most myself was that the ending was kind of boring. In the middle of the book a big secret is revealed: August set fire to the orchard. This secret is perfect -- it feels obvious in retrospect because it makes sense considering who he is at that time, but it wasn't obvious before you read it. Meanwhile the secret revealed at the end basically boils down to Leoda is evil. We don't know her well, so learning about her past decision with Lily does not feel like a puzzle piece falling into place at all. Instead it feels a bit contrived, at least to me. I felt similarly about Dutch. I wanted to understand his character more. And while I was ready for him to be a not great person, I expected him to be at least nuanced. In the end, though, he is basically just bitter, jealous of August, and a misogynist.

On a similar vein, there are a lot of other townspeople who should have really interesting perspectives on the events of the book. Noah is perhaps the worst example. He attends these council meetings and has gone along with despicable things in the past, and he has to come to terms with that and decide to be different this time. But do we get to understand why or what he's thinking in that moment? No. Do we get a reflection on it later? No. We get nothing. What about Albertine? What about Nixie? These characters are interesting and I wanted more from them, but in the end they only serve functional roles in progressing the story.

# My Rating
Spells for Forgetting isn't perfect. I learned in book club that it isn't for everyone, and even for me it has some plot holes and conveniences that take away from its quality. That being said, I loved reading this book. I loved the atmosphere and the characters and most of all the mystery. I kept wanting to come back to read. I stayed up too late reading. I finished it faster than I have any book in a while. And most importantly I came away very glad I read it.

It is definitely not as good as June Farrow, and on reflection I see that the writing has some issues. But I loved it. So it doesn't get an A+ because it's below June Farrow in my subjective opinion, and it gets a A- because it also has some issues that I think an A tier book wouldn't have. But it goes no lower because I still loved it way more than any B tier book.
