I really enjoyed the beginning of this book. Not only is the premise extremely interesting, but the atmosphere and characterization is also well executed and together you can't help but be drawn in by the story. As the story proceed, thematic ideas are clearly prevalent, but unfortunately the plot does not serve to compliment these ideas very well. Overall it's a very good read with a lot of great ideas and cool nuances, but while the plot is fun, it doesn't create a purposely crafted thematic ending in the way and A+ version might have.
