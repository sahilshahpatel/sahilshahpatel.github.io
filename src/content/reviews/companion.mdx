It's hard to talk about Companion without comparing it to Ex Machina. Both movies have similar central ideas and convey similar themes. Companion tries less to be a surprise -- it's mystery is not really in the fact that a robot exists. Rather, it has surprises in store concerning the exact plot and how it will unfold.

Companion is not as good as Ex Machina, probably. It's a lot more digestible, though, and might appeal to a different audience because it focuses more on thriller elements earlier in the movie. I don't have too much more to say besides that if you liked Ex Machina it's worth watching companion. You'll likely be able to guess where it's going and what it wants to say, but it's entertaining throughout regardless.
