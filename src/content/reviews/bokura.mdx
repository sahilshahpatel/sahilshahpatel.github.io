# My Review
Bokura is an excellent two-play online co-op game that's playable in probably one to three sessions depending on length. The puzzles are well designed (not too easy or too hard), the story is interesting and keeps you wanting to progress, and the thematics are satisfying. I had a great time playing this game and would easily recommend it. In fact my only criticism was a small bit about the ending.

I should note that this game is an asymetric information game. In other words, each player sees something different, and you must work together to solve puzzles. When I was looking up this game before buying it, I heard that even knowing this fact would ruin some of the game. I firmly disagree. The game itself keys you into this fact pretty early on, and it is core to the gameplay, plot, and thematics. There are sections where you are told not to talk (in which you see separate cutscenes). In my opinion, the game is best played by talking about those scenes together once they have ended and you've both come back together (specifically when the "choice" appears).

I did have one small complaint with how the ending is handled. If you play the game once, you'll see one ending. If you play the game again with the same person but swap characters you'll see an extension to that ending, and then an epilogue of sorts will unlock. Completing the epilogue shows you the final end of the story. I only played through it once and didn't much have a desire to play it all again. Really, I think they could have easily just shown the extension the first time and unlocked the epilogue right away. I would have loved that and definitely played it.

## Spoilers Ahead
SPOILERS AHEAD, so don't read on if you want to play the game yourself (which I recommend).

My complaint does go a little farther. In the first ending of the game, it seems to suggest that Haru is the monster. But the evidence is unclear and I chose to believe that Haru wasn't the monster himself but instead was also eaten by the monster. But the epilogue makes it clear that this interpretation is not true, and I think that is to the detriment of the story's themes. The whole thing is quite metaphorical (with the two main characters literally living in two worlds), and so I expected that the monster was a metaphor for depression or trauma. In that reading, Haru is still consumed by the monster and cannot escape it even after the other characters have. I don't really understand what it means for Haru to be the monster. He might have thought himself a monster to his parents, but he has no reason to see himself that way towards our main characters.

And a small other nitpick is that it's weird to me that the main characters would not go back for Haru until decades later. That just feels wrong with their characters and the lesson they learn at the end. In fact, the extension shows them watching him walk away, which is just crazy!

A last similar nitpick is that the ending suggests that the events of the game were part of the reason why the friends drifted apart. I don't like this at all because again they just learned a lesson in friendship and empathy at the end of the main plot. If anything, this should have strengthened their friendship! And this small detail doesn't really change the story much -- they were super young at the time, and so I am fine with them growing apart over time in general, just not with these events and their "guilt" as being one of the initial reasons why.

That being said, all these small complaints are really only about driving home the exact themes that I wanted at the very end. They are mostly negligable, really, and I was able to take out of the game what I wanted. It was super enjoyable, it made me think, and it made me care, and I can't ask for more than that.
