I had a lot of preconceived notions coming into Her. Knowing that it was a story about AI love, I originally thought it would be overly critical about it and basically make fun of the concept. I heard more about the movie and saw a lot of comments like "only a man could fall in love with a robot" or describing the guy as an incel or just generally relating the themes of the movie to issues of masculinity.

After watching it myself, I feel like both of these impressions were completely off the mark. Thinking it was going to be overly critical was just my own bias and expectation given the premise. But the issues of masculinity bent actually quite bothers me, because I think people who feel that way about the movie missed the point completely.

Her is a movie all about loneliness and connection. It concerns itself with how technology has changed our patterns of socialization for better and for worse, and runs a thought experiment on the end game of the course we are set for. It is slow and ponderous, and so not for everyone. But it gives real weight to the topic at hand and explores many nuances that lesser films would have disregarded.

The first thing I want to highlight is the way in which the film focuses on its main point. Most sci-fi stories of this nature would have a lot of dystopian elements all mixed together. But for loneliness in particular, I think it makes a lot of sense that the world of Her seems quite utopian. Characters work fairly average jobs but have amazing places to live. The city seems beautiful and travel seems easy and affordable. This all serves to highlight that even if technology puts us into some kind of post-scarcity world, that won't have solved all of our problems. Loneliness, as it turns out, cannot be solved with supply-side tactics.

The next thing which has to be discussed is the topic of sex. Sex comes up a lot in this movie, and often in ways that are quite uncomfortable. I think this is what makes people refer to masculinity issues. It's uncomfortable, and so it's easier to call it problematic than it is to look at what's really trying to be said. The movie goes out of its way to provide good analogies for everything that happens. It starts with phone sex with another human (which is weird) and then shows phone sex with Samantha (which is less weird). But then it also shows the surrogate situation which is a clearly non-analogous thing and it breaks down. But crucially phone sex remains a part of their relationship. The question of how human sexuality interacts with evolving methods of communication is one that is relevant with and without the presence of AI, and I think the movie illustrates that quite well. It's just controversial and taboo enough a topic that many audiences will pretend ignorance.

Now let's talk about our main character Theodore. He is not an incel in my mind, but he's also certainly not a perfect person. It's shown that he had expectations around his relationship with Catherine that were not realistic, and that he couldn't adapt to those differences when they showed up. This could be related to some incel ideologies, but I think the issue isn't that Theodore expected Catherine to be an object or treasure, but rather that like many people in all kinds of relationships, Theodore struggled with communication during difficult times, and his reality slowly drifted from his expectations until everything all the sudden broke. That happens to many people in all kinds of relationships. In fact, I really liked how he was shown to be flawed, but still relatable. His flaws are real and fairly readily identifiable, but they don't actually consume him in everyday life. That just felt so real to every flaw I've ever identified in myself, and so real to the flaws I've seen in others too.

A related element of Theodore is that he is somewhat antisocial, but still has friends. I thought this too added so much realism to the film. It's not that Theodore is such an outcast that he can't meet people. In fact he was probably a very normal person for a long time. But his insecurities were made raw by his divorce, and from that his antisocial tendencies reared their head and got in the way of his life. That made new relationships hard and probably strained old ones too, but that doesn't mean he doesn't have friends.

I really don't know how to summarize this movie. It was so nuanced in its discussion of very controversial and taboo topics. It illustrated both beauty and absurdism around the same central story in a way that allows you to come away with either opinion, but hopefully with a new understanding of the other side. Perhaps some of that is my projection onto the movie, but in the group I watched this with, at least half of us felt the same way. I think there's an argument that this movie belongs in S- tier, because I really loved the writing, cinematography, and the acting. I think the story was very moving and well-told too. For now, after just having watched it, I'll place it in A+ instead. But I could see this movie sticking with me for a long time, and for that it deserves credit.
