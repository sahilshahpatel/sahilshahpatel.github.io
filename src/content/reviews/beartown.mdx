# Review in Summary
I loved this book for the story it tells and the way it tells it. It is brooding and reflective in an almost cinematic way. The writing style is so unique and serves well to hit home the heavy themes and stories that accompany it.

# Full Review
Beartown is a surprisingly multifaceted story. You read the inside flap and think it will be about hockey, and maybe small town politics. And it is about those things. But it also about wealth and poverty, about men and women, about those included and those left behind. It's about honor and self interest, and about rage and sorrow.

Even the side characters whose stories have almost nothing to do with the main plot -- they contribute to the overall mood and by the end it's hard to describe exactly why their stories mattered, but they absolutely did. Robbie, Filip, Ramona, Bobo -- even Tails in the end. Their stories help deconstruct Beartown and its culture. They help explain how a town like that comes to be.

But the main story -- Maya, Kevin, Benji, Amat as well as the adults Peter, Kira, and David -- they are also not one dimensional. Backman does a great job of developing contradictions in his characters so that you're never exactly sure what they'll do, but whatever they do end up doing always makes sense. And the presence of that internal conflict is not just for intrigue. It really is the whole point.

Often I think that stories are better served focusing on a single thing. Not because life isn't complex but because stories are about condensing that complexity, and there is a delicate balance where having too many ideas can dilute the importance of any one. Beartown is an excellent counter argument to that belief. In the end, the complexities of the many themes enhance each other and form a single cohesive idea and feeling.

In particular I think that Backman's deconstruction of gender themes is just excellent. From the female perspective we get a wide range of archetypes: Kira the career woman, Ramona the tough one, Maggan the defensive, and Kevin's mom (whose name I don't think we actually learn) the regretful. From the male perspective we see the same: Peter the pacifist, Zacharias the bullied, Kevin the privileged, Benji the honorable, and so on. Each of these characters experience masculinity differently, and they process the female experience differently too. And its only through the sum total of it all that the true complexity of the issue can be discussed.

The other main theme, in my opinion, is inclusion and exclusion. This ties into sports culture and small town culture, but it also touches on classism and a little on racism as well. I won't go into the same detail as above, but it's equally well described I think.

Ultimately, it's not the plot of this book, per se, that is the main attraction. It's the mood and the themes and the self reflection that it encourages. It's an easy recommendation and an excellent book.
