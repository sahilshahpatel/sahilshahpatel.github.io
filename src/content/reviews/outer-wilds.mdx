This review encompasses just the main game. I have not yet played the DLC Echoes of the Eye.

# Review In Summary
Outer Wilds is just amazing. It's atmospheric story telling is top notch and it progresses to a finale that is honestly so perfect it's astonishing.

# Full Review
Most of this review is going to be me gushing, but I do have one criticism which I'll get to later. Let's break down my favorite bits.

## The genre
I don't know an official name for the genre of this game, but I'll call it an "Environmental Mystery". Outer Wilds was the first game I played like this (the second was [The Forgotten City](the-forgotten-city) to which you'll see a few comparisons) so I did not know what to expect. You're given the initial suggestion that you are an astronaut and should go out and explore the solar system, but past that you're never really told what to do. It's your own curiosity that propels you forward, and your discoveries along the way slowly put together the grand puzzle until you can finally see the point of it all and stand there amazed.

I give Outer Wilds so much credit for being innovative in this way. For inventing a new type of video game experience, and for pretty much nailing it on the first attempt. There's another thing I love about the genre too, which deserves it's own heading...

## Video games as a medium
I like considering the specific abilities of certain mediums for stories. Books, for example, allow you to see into the minds of characters easily. This is harder for movies to do, but they can, for example, add environmental details which are meant to be consumed by the subconscious which books cannot do.

Video games are also a medium for story telling. They share a lot in common with movies, but add interaction. Not all games take advantage of this narratively, though. And to be clear I don't think you <em>have</em> to do this to be a good game. But it's worth pointing out the games that do, and I think Outer Wilds is one.

The real joy of the story of Outer Wilds comes from the fact that you discover it yourself. The clues are laid out, but they are not at all linear, and your path of discovery is likely to be completely different to your friend's. The fact that the story progresses exactly according to your actions connects you to the characters and to the solar system itself in a way that's hard to replicate.

## The trinkets
As a programmer and lover of physics and astronomy, it's so easy to see that the creators of Outer Wilds have the same fascinations as me. There are just some plain <em>cool</em> ideas in this game. Cyclones supporting an outer shell of water, the elliptical orbit of a comet melting its ice when it's near the sun, the quantum moon, all of these things are just joys to experience. My favorite of all is the black hole white hole pair in the lab where you can see the time effect. It's so small and they really didn't have to put it in there, but they did and I'm so glad!

## The ending
I don't want to spoil the ending because even if I did I wouldn't be able to capture the experience properly and it would ruin it for you later. Suffice to say it's spectacular. As you play the game you're observing everything and you're trying to figure out how it all pieces together. Parts of the story fit neatly with each other, but they don't match other chunks, and its not until the very end that you understand the whole picture. The end is not a twist. It's exactly what it should be, the only thing it could be, and yet you probably won't have figured it all out until its right before you. Endings like that are fantastically hard to write and rare to experience, but they are the best thing ever.

## My one critique
My one critique is the ramp up for this game. The beauty of it all comes from it being self directed, and yet there is an art to giving just enough initial direction to get the player into the thick of it, after which they can direct themselves.

In my experience, Outer Wilds didn't quite get this right. When I first started playing this game, I walked around Timber Hearth for a while, and eventually tried to fly to Giant's Deep. I died a few times getting used to the clunky controls before I finally made it there. Once I did, I got blown away by the storms and died several more times. By the end of it all I had learned really nothing, and felt like maybe I had just made a mistake by picking Giant's Deep first.

The truth is that I just didn't understand the core of the game yet. I didn't get that I wasn't <em>supposed</em> to know what to do. I didn't understand how the clunky controls are part of the environmental story telling.

I put the game down for while. In fact I didn't pick it up for months (for some unrelated reasons too). When I picked it up again, this time I was able to push through the initial bump, and once you learn one thing and see the connecting strings you quickly get sucked into the game.

I will also say that the end for me had a similar speed bump. I finished it without another long break, but the final puzzle also stumped me for a bit, and since I was back down to only one thing to do, it wasn't as easy to float around to other parts of the world, trying things until I found something noteworthy.

In the end I feel that the game suffers from these two speed bumps. And they are just that -- slight inhibitors that can interrupt your momentum in playing the game. But if you can get over them (and they are not that steep), the game you get in return is absolutely amazing.
