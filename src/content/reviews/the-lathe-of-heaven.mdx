The Lathe of Heaven is a very strange story. Unfortunately, I am writing this review at least a month after having read it, and that might be too much time to properly describe what I thought at the time because of how complex it is. I'll do my best.

The central premise of the Lathe of Heaven is that our main character George Orr can change the reality of the world by dreaming. When he awakes from such "effective dreams", he sees that the world is now the way he had dreamed it, different than what it had been before he woke up. Generally others do not notice this difference, although if they are close to him as it happens they may.

The ideas the Le Guin touches on through this premise are about our role and responsibility in this world, and what we should do with power when we have it. Ultimately, Orr settles on a very Daoist philosophy of allowing for the natural course of these changes. Another character, Dr. Haber, wants to take a much more active role in shaping the world, but he continually finds that the end result is not exactly what he had in mind even if it is in the right direction by some measures.

I quite liked this exploration of the premise. It gets weird fast and even weirder by the end. And it's philosophy is one that I jive with generally, so it felt good to read it and feel understood to some extent. However, the ending does not hammer home anything very specific. It is like some short stories in that its more about the experience of having gone through it all than it is about the final act. For an idea as novel as this, I think that can work. And crucially this is a novella and not a full novel. So while I didn't find it entirely satisfying, it also wasn't unsatisfying exactly.

For now I'll leave it as an A- because I liked many parts of it, but I think it's style is very particular and most wouldn't enjoy it as much as I did, even though I myself would not rank it among my favorites.
