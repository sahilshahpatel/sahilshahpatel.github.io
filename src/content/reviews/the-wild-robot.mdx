This movie is the cheesiest thing you'll ever see. The animation is great, and of course I teared up, but I was expecting a lot better storytelling based on all the good things I was hearing. Instead, the story is a little too quickly paced because they try and get so many separate chapters of these characters' lives into the same movie. The emotional moments are extremely obvious, one-note, and cheesy. This doesn't rob them of their effect, but it does mean I just can't rate it that highly.

And as a last quick note, I want to point out the movie made sure to specifically mention that animals showing kindness to each other was good, but that the ecosystem did require animals to prey on each other, and a friendship circle wasn't the answer. Despite this, they kind of do from a friendship circle, and the idea of the circle of life really just gets completely dropped from that moment on. I felt it was an odd choice to even include that philosophy if it wasn't going to show up later.

That being said, the movie isn't really bad in any way. It's just that the writing isn't great. Solid watch if you want a tear-jerker kids movie. Not worth your time if you're hoping for anything thematically complex.
