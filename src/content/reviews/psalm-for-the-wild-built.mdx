This book was initially recommended to me in a way that made me interested, but not feeling any urgency to read it immediately. Later it was recommended again, this time with a lot more fervor, and so I picked it up.

Overall, I quite liked this book. It's short and sweet with an interesting world and two interesting characters. It was clear from the outset that this book was going to give a take on the philosophical question of finding purpose in life, and I was definitely looking forward to that.

The middle bit of this story still felt like it dragged a little, but it wasn't too bad. Really I was most disappointed by the very last sentence. After a really interesting discussion between Dex and Mosscap, Dex wakes up from a nap and seems still a little troubled as they explain their feelings to Mosscap over tea. And then sort of suddenly without any prompting, they just decide that the next thing they'll do is continue on with Mosscap, this time towards it's goals instead of their own.

I know that that is actually fairly realistic. Our feelings come in big waves, and often times the seas calm without the true problem having been solved, but the emotion just needed an outlet. And I'm ok with that. But in a 3rd person omniscient perspective, I would have like to hear about Dex acknowledging the nature of what just happened before moving on. Especially since they brought it back up literal seconds beforehand.

That's my only nitpick. Otherwise this was a fun story to read, a good length, and had a philosophy I find myself agreeing with, so what more can I ask for?
