If I had to summarize my opinion on this book in one adjective it would be "amateurish". The plot is basic and predictable. Even though it has a fairly interesting premise, the actual grandeur of the events feels diminished and childish in Sloan's hands for reasons I can't exactly articulate. The characters are all one-note and unchanging. In particular, it seems like Sloan wanted to show some feminism by making Kate so smart and active in the story, but instead only ended up writing a different modern stereotype of the quirky tech woman. I was most disappointed by Mr. Penumbra himself who was set up to have an interesting take on the intersection between reverence for the old and new. In the end, he also felt childish and immature in the face of the real question being asked.

I have to be fair and admit that a lot of my dislike for this book also comes from how much it seems to praise Silicon Valley (and Google in particular). I just heavily disagree with the portrayal in the book. It's not that Silicon Valley is all bad or evil or something, but this book does not at all take a nuanced look at the pros and cons of the culture we've built here.

The book could be entertaining -- it's not particularly awful per se. But it's definitely bad at almost everything it tries to do in a way that ruins whatever promise it might otherwise have had.
