Shards of Honor is an old school Sci-Fi novel and love story about Cordelia Naismith and Aral Vorkosigan. Both main characters are quite resourceful and easy to like, though Vorkosigan comes from a very authoritarian and warlike planet.

Bujold has crafted a unique universe, one that reminds me a little of Dune in the intricacies of the politics. However, it is all very background. Unlike Dune, Shards of Honor is much more focused on how the politics affects it's characters (rather than how the characters can affect the politics). This is generally more my kind of story, and so I quite liked it!

My main criticism is a personal preference. The love story evolves really rapidly for my taste. The main reason for Cordelia being attracted to Vorkosigan is "because he's hot and honorable" and the main reason Vorkosigan is attracted to Cordelia is that she -- by nature of not being a Barrayaran like him -- is honorable too? I would have preferred a lot more buildup to the romance. Some plot elements to convince me that they are good for each other, and to ease the transition from enemies to lovers.

But once again, Bujold is just going for something else. She's far more interested in how being in love will affect the characters than she is in exactly how/why they fall in love. And that's a fine choice to make, just not my personal preference.

Overall this is a pretty good novel that certainly has me interested in reading what's next!
