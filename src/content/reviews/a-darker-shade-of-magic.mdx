A Darker Shade of Magic was a pretty engaging book. I found myself excited to get back in the car to keep listening, and I wanted to know what would happen to Kell and Lilah. I think this comes down to what is an amazing premise for a book. The idea of four Londons, each parallel and with varying levels of magic and cultures around it is so fascinating! I do think it's quite hard to come up with such a good premise and describe it so well without boring amounts of exposition, so I want to give Schwab credit for that. Unfortunately, I didn't love the direction of the second half, and ended up feeling disappointed with the execution.

My primary gripe is the pacing of the exposition vs. the plot. The beginning makes you intrigued about the world, and you want to explore it. At least for me, the beginning of this book made me expect that we would venture into each London one at a time and learn more about it each time. Especially knowing that this was a series, I expected each book to focus primarily on one London. Perhaps I was assuming too much there, but I do think the start of this novel really points in that direction. That's not the only expectation that is falsely created either. I saw three big ones:
- We're set up to see White London as a potential adversary but not the main villain -- that's supposed to be Black London
- We're set up to think that both Lila and Kell returning to their homelands was going to be a major conflict to be resolved
- We're set up wonder about the mystery of Holland.

None of these things really have good resolutions by the end, nor are they left very open for later in the series. It feels like there were so many good ideas, but then Schwab panicked about fitting it all in one book and so wrapped it up hastily without getting to the real meat of what she had in front of her. Now, I haven't read the further books in the series (nor do I plan to), so perhaps the direction it ends up going would change my mind. But I do believe that books should be standalone even when part of a series. That's why we don't publish an entire series in one go. There are layers of self-similar structures but with varying levels of independence. Chapters can make up acts which make up books which make up series. Chapters and acts are not standalone, but books and series should be. In this case, even if the series recontextualizes the book into a better light, I still think the book failed as a standalone.

I do want to give a quick shoutout to Barron, who I think is a very well written character. He's obviously a very minor character, but his few actions and few words characterize him extremely well. And most of all his character really is just a way to tell the story of Lilah indirectly, which it also does extremely well.

And one last note is that the physical book apparently has short stories in the appendix! I do wish I'd been able to read those, though I don't know if they would change my overall opinion.

So, while this review is mostly critical, I actually enjoyed this book overall. It was a fun read and the premise is SO GOOD. While the end was disappointing to me, it was more a case of knowing how amazing this book could have been than it was feeling that the book was bad per se. I could easily recommend this as a YA read to any fantasy fan and be confident that they would enjoy it.
