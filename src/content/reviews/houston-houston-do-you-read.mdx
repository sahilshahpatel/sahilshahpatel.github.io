I'm writing this more than a month after reading the story, so my analysis won't be as strong or as long. This story starts out... shall we say agressively. I was pretty turned off by the grotesque sexuality and the intensity of the misogyny, and wasn't sure how much I'd like the story afterwards. But over time I came to understand the perspective the story was trying to give, and I really appreciated it.

During our discussion we touched a little bit on where this story was on a pro-women to anti-men spectrum (of course an oversimplification). While the plot goes in the direction of only women existing equaling a better and less violent society, I don't think the conclusion was necessarily that men are the only source of violence in the world. Rather, it was about how toxicity and violence are cultural viruses, and they will infect a culture whose defenses are weak enough.

Additionally, we talked about how each of the three male astronauts represent different ways in which men develop misogyny. There is the bully who views women as objects and seeks them out only for pleasure but does not view them as real people. There is the weakling who do not want women just for the sake of it -- and so may consider themselves "nice guys" if you will -- but actually they want women to prove to other men that they really aren't that weak and are deserving of respect. And there is the religious fanatic who view women as a representation of the purity of mankind, but in doing so disregard their own morals and the agency of women in their life.

And lastly, I always love a story where a character knows they're the problem and surrenders willingly. I find that dynamic so interesting. And while the scientist is still very much a misogyny, I can respect that he did finally understand how beautiful a world without all that toxic masculinity might be, and decided that he wouldn't allow himself to be an obstacle on the path towards that objective.
