Tai-Pan is such an interesting novel. It's a fictional history of the founding of Hong Kong, where the main character is the head of an opium trading company and the story is about his vision for Hong Kong and how he plays the game of the politics of the time.

Let me start by saying that I found Tai Pan so entertaining. Surprisingly so, to be honest. The start of it is a bit slow, and in-detail historical fiction isn't always my favorite. But the story quickly ramps with so much political intrigue. The clashing of cultures and ideologies manifests in a lot of game-playing and positioning.

# The Problem of Struan
Let's be real -- Dirk Struan is way overdone in this story. He is the smartest guy in China, has the best of both European and Chinese culture, despite being ruthless his goals feel the most altruistic of anyone, and the list goes on and on. Struan is credited with almost every major decision made regarding Hong Kong. If it wasn't him directly, it was at his suggestion or through his manipulation.

This is the biggest reason why Clavell cannot really discuss the ethics of the opium trade. To do so would tarnish the impeccable image of Struan. And to be honest, I'm ok with that. I don't condone the opium trade of course, but I can understand the story this book was trying to tell and the details it had to specifically ignore in order to tell that story. So for the most part, I will ignore the ethical criticism of opium, and I'll forgive Struan for having the biggest main character syndrome of all time.

# The Politics
Where Clavell excels is in his politics. Because we are often in Struan's mind, we get the best perspective to understand the complex relationships of the era. I also liked that although people like Longstaff are constantly manipulated by Struan, we still get to see their thought process occasionally. When Culum shows up, he provides a youthful and/or naive perspective that contrasts nicely with Struan himself. Early on Robb also provides some of this more innocent perspective.

I'd also be remiss if I did not mention the women in the story. Due to the time period, they obviously do not have nearly as much agency as the men. Still, though, they do express agency from within the confines of their oppression. Mary's story early on does this, May May does throughout as well, and Shevaun has this for a bit before the collapse at the end (which is as devastating as it is period-accurate unfortunately).

# A Vision for the Future
Another thing I really liked was Struan's vision for the future. Of course it is a gracious perspective towards colonizers, but I liked that he was adopting a lot of Chinese customs as he found wisdom in them, but also believed that representation, the rule of law, the abolishment of slavery, etc. were "European values" to be brought to China. The fact that he has this vision and that he develops a plan for bringing it to fruition is what really drives the intrigue in the story.

That being said, I was a little disappointed based off of the beginning. Early on Struan has an encounter with Jin-Qua where we learn that Jin-Qua himself has a plan. He sees some value in these Europeans but wants them to become "civilized" (read: more Chinese). I was really hoping for a story that went back and forth between these two people playing the game of trying to influence on another in their own ways. While this is still ostensibly what is happening, the story focuses way more on the Europeans than the Chinese whose only real representative is May May.

# Shoutout to the Narrator
I have to give serious props to the narrator of the audio book Gildart Jackson. There are so many characters in this story and there are so many accents too. And Jackson just nails them all! You can always tell who is speaking just based on his voice. And none of his accents are so bad they're distracting (as you might expect with say the Chinese accents). He speaks with a Scottish accent, a Chinese one, an American one, a posh English and a common English one, just to name a few. If you're going to give this book a try, I highly recommend the audio version.

# The End
SPOILERS in this section, obviously.

I was a little disappointed by the end. I don't think it's badly written. It actually makes sense given the context that this book is a part of a series, and the story continues on from here. But the direction that it continues in was surprising to me, and not in the best way. Struan's plans for Hong Kong are basically null and void. Culum hasn't had enough time to even really learn about his father's plans, so he doesn't even get the choice of deciding if he wants to follow in his father's steps. May May, who is perhaps the best character in the whole book, just dies having done little of what her story promised. Ultimately it ends the storylines I cared about most prematurely, and what is left feels less interesting than what we started with.

The way it is ended too -- the typhoon -- felt way too convenient. The book doesn't really feel like it's winding down at all, but you know you are getting towards the end. And then all of the sudden there's a typhoon coming and you know exactly what's going to happen. But that happening doesn't feel satisfying or cathartic at all! Instead I felt like I was robbed of a real ending.

# Conclusion
I was worried that Tai-Pan wouldn't keep my interest. I'm not always huge on detail in historical fiction, and this book certainly has that. It's also just very long. But as mundane as the plot sometimes is, the characters and the scenario are just so intriguing that I constantly wanted to come back to read, which is the hallmark of a great book to me. While the ending wasn't my favorite, it didn't ruin the rest of it or anything (especially because of the actual last paragraph which brought it back up in my regard). Overall this was a super fun book to read, and I'd easily recommend it to anyone who is interested in this period in history.
