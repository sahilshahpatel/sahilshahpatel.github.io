Gods of Jade and Shadow reminds me a lot of Rick Riordan's writing. That comparison is true on the surface level -- both are mythological stories set in the modern world -- but it's also true a little deeper. Both are fairly simple adventure stories, written (in my view) for a younger audience and therefore containing less complex writing and themes.

That's not to say that the book is bad. I actually really enjoyed reading it myself. Especially because I read it after a few heavier books in a row, this light adventure story was a great, fun read. The main character Casiopea is relatable, and her human antagonists in her grandfather and in Martín are both despicable and pitiful. The slow ways in which Casiopea changes Hun-Kamé keep you interested in the story throughout.

That being said, it definitely is lacking some depth that I thought it might have. You would imagine this story to be a feminist one based on the beginning. However, Casiopea is never really empowered in any way. Because she is surrounded by gods and her more-wealthy family, other characters always have more agency that she does. In fact, her final heroic act is to surrender all of her agency and to sort of win by accident. Not that I even hated that moment per se, but it certainly underlined a lack of the theme of empowerment throughout the story.

Martín also could have been written better. I really liked that you got to hear his thoughts every once in a while. You could see the insecurity that even he himself did not understand. And as much as you hate him, you also hope that he can get better if only not to continue the cycle of abuse and arrogance. However, his story also doesn't really go anywhere. His final "heroic" act is to not do something absolutely terribly immoral and instead do something slightly less terribly immoral. I needed a lot more change in him, or at least a more aggressive hint at future change to be satisfied.

And finally Hun-Kamé who seems to go through a lot of change, but at the end it amounts to very little. I honestly liked that they didn't go full cliché on the ending, but it again failed to deliver on the whispers of a theme that were given at the beginning of the story.

So if you're reading this for themes or ideas or character development, don't bother. But if you just want a fun adventure story with a fairly unique and humorous tone and a main character you can root for in her battle to survive in the face of forces wildly more powerful than herself, then this book will give you just that. I tend to want the former, so I think it's a decent compliment for this book which is so clearly the latter to still be put in A tier.
