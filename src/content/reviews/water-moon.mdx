I just don't really get what the point of this novel was. What was the idea? Why was it written? It's a very cool premise, but it doesn't come together into anything cohesive as far as I could tell.

I kinda hated Keishin. I think his physics background was super annoying and also didn't really factor into his decision making besides cute metaphors the author wanted to make (but which landed poorly IMO).

Hana was fine but her motivations were super confusing. She kept going back and forth about whether she belonged with Keishin and those moments came at quite random times, not spurred by anything in particular. The "twist" didn't work for me at all because it just didn't really fit her character. We're told time and again that she was trained to be a manipulator but I just don't see that really. When does that seem true? Also she is supposed to hate destiny but then doesn't in certain moments. And she is supposed to be incapable of making decisions but that's just seems flat out untrue and its confusing why she continues to believe it.

The plot was super basic and lame. Every time something new was introduced you could be sure it would be the solution to the problem that would occur in 5 pages. Nothing was built up to or hinted at or anything. It was just jumping from conflict to resolution with no in-between.

The end is kind of weird too. I feel like it's supposed to mean something but at least to me there was no clear theme there at all.

It was a fun read because the universe is interesting, but it doesn't do anything well besides that.
