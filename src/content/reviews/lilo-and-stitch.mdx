*Lilo and Stitch* is a Disney classic that I somehow never watched as a kid. It was highly recommended to me by a few people, and so I finally got around to watching it myself. In the end, I think it's a quintessential Disney movie -- and one of the better ones!

The plot and themes of this movie are fairly straightforward and predictable, but the characters are so lovable and relatable that you want to see it play out anyways. Stitch was surprisingly funny to me. I know Disney movies are always comedic, but I really didn't expect it to work for me as much as it did. And watching as an adult, while I can certainly still relate to Lilo a lot, Nani's perspective on the story really resonated with me.

The sci-fi space civilization and its rules are pretty absurd and random, but I don't think that's really the point. Ultimately they are just there to set up the relationship between Lilo and Stitch and its effects on Nani as well. And it does that job perfectly! *Lilo and Stitch* enters the list of my favorite Disney movies and is probably the best of its era (though I'd have to think some about that before confirming), so it easily earns a place in A tier.
