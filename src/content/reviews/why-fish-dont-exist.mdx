I've said it before, but I don't tend to like nonfiction. One book that convinced me to revise that statement was [_Educated_](educated). After reading it, I decided that memoirs would be an exception to that generalization. I figured that it was really narrative that I craved, not fiction necessarily. So when _Why Fish Don't Exist_ was recommended to me, I decided it might be worth a shot. It was a memoir, the historical piece seemed interesting and was a topic I was clueless about, and I love a good set of interwoven narratives.

And so I have to say, I came away a bit disappointed by this book. The historical part was good, but that parts that were most interesting were the parts with the least answers. (How did an abolitionist turn into a eugenicist? Did he acknowledge the hypocrisy there or did he see reason in it? What did his descendants think of the murder story? What does modern-day Stanford have to say about him regarding both the eugenics and the murder? And so on...) The memoir side of it wasn't _bad_, it just wasn't that interesting. Let me explain.

# What Defines and Essay?
I really do believe that this book is an essay disguised as a memoir. Miller's personal story has no real narrative to it at all. She has one defining event that can be considered "plot" (when curly-haired-man breaks up with her), and besides that it is just a bunch of philosophical discussion. She even tries to make it seem like there is a plot of her going back to Jordan's story over time to make sense of her own life, but I find that falls short. Not only is it a really bare-bones "plot", but it also feels extremely fabricated. Perhaps it's that I've listened to a lot of radio stories or perhaps its that the publication dates she gives for Jordan's work that don't seem to align with the way she discusses history's view of him. Whatever it is, it feels like Miller while did find Jordan's story interesting and might have known about it for a while, she probably grasped the connection to her own story much later and wrapped it up in this book. I doubt that she was really feeling this connection in real time. (And maybe I'm wrong on the facts there, but even if I am, her writing feeling inauthentic is still an issue of its own.)

So she talks about her problems and her fatalism and how she finds a new perspective. And honestly I don't mind that. I like the ideas she has and I understand the struggle she faces. But I was expecting a memoir, a narrative. I was promised a crescendo of plot and emotion and themes that all coalesce into the message. Instead it was just told to me, like the thesis of an essay.

# Final Thoughts
This book isn't bad. It might deserve better than what I'm giving it, to be honest. But I was quite disappointed by it. The ideas, while ones I agree with, were not portrayed in a novel way at all. I didn't feel like Miller had a unique perspective or individually interesting story to tell. So ultimately I can't give it too much credit for saying something that's been said many times before, and not any better.
