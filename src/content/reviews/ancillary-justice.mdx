Ancillary Justice is a very hard book to review. I found it really enjoyable and kept wanting to read more the whole time, which is usually such a good sign. And yet the end is such an unbelievable nothing-burger that it left me questioning the whole experience and whether it was worth anything.

My favorite parts were all the flashback scenes with Lieutenant Awn. I found that story extremely compelling and by the end was even wondering if this same universe would have been better explored through their eyes instead. (Seriously though, a novel about only the flashbacks which ends in the terrible injustice of her death would have been so interesting!)

The second element which I initially enjoyed was the mystery of what happened to Breq and what she was up to. You find out eventually that (spoilers ahead!) she wants to kill Anaander Mianaai and that is a great twist because we still don't actually find out why. Once that final piece is revealed though, the whole thing falls apart in my opinion. Breq supposedly doesn't like either version of Anaander, but then she's forced to work with Anaander to some extent and by the end all of Breq's motivations are confused and unsubstantiated. The very ending and the hook for the next book was so disappointing because it seals the deal as far as Breq just making no sense.

Besides that I also found a few less relevant things just kind of annoying. I don't mind the principle of the Radch not having gender and the use of the pronoun "she" for everybody. What I did mind was that Breq keeps saying she is unsure about other cultures' gender divisions and worries about a faux pas because that worry never manifests at all! All of that discussion is completely irrelevant to the plot in any way, and that was just weird.

Even more than that one, I really dislike the spellings in this book. Quite positive aside, but the audio book narrator for Ancillary Justice was amazing. She used different accents for different worlds and very distinct voices for our different characters which was great. But before starting the audio book I was actually reading this physically, and the pronunciations were so far away from what I had imagined. My one concession is that I am American biased, so while I did dislike that the "awe"-like sounds turned into rhotic ones in the audio book, I recognize that that is a British feature and isn't objectively bad. But whatever I just disliked them. Spelling it "Anaander" when it's pronounced "ana anda" is just mean. Why "Preger" when it sounds like "Preska"? Why "Radchaai" when it's pronounced "Rachi'i"? It's almost like the author wanted to invent a new language for their sci-fi story but then forgot transliteration isn't just for a coolness factor but needs to contain functional explanations of pronunciation and should not require a guide to follow.

So yeah, I'm a little annoyed at this book. The world is quite interesting, and some of the characters have good moments. But reading it was quite a pain until I switched to the audio book, and the ending was so uninspiring that it collapsed my faith in the rest of it.
