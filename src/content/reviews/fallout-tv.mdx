# Season 1
_At the time of writing, Season 1 is the only season out. I also have not played any of the games, though I did know the general premise._

This show was definitely a surprise. We've had a few good video game adaptations in the past couple years (I'm looking at you, Arcane, and you, The Last of Us), but I did not expect Fallout to make that list. But I started hearing such good things that I had to give it a chance, and I'm glad I did.

The show starts off decently comical, mostly because vault society is just so funny. Even before we are shown the wasteland, we already know the great irony of vault life and can already sense the naivety. Just with the start, I was still a little on the fence about the show. I knew Fallout had some comedic elements to it, and I was worried the show would lean too far into that.

But when tradgedy strikes vault 33, the show quickly takes on its main tone. It doesn't shy away from the violence and destruction of this post-apocalyptic world, but it also gives it proper nuance, showing us characters' motivations and reasons for taking their actions. Lucy is the perfect protagonist because she is immensely likable and we can relate to her deeply. Maximus serves and an excellent opposite -- someone who was raised in the wasteland and who knows its violence intimately but who has a chance to change for the positive.

The show's twist isn't unexpected in the sense that you know that something is shady the whole time, but the exact manner of the twist was definitely unexpected in the best way possible. Keeping Lucy's brother in the vault as the mechanism for that story was a great choice too, providing some reprieve from the wild and making what I thought would be a complete side character into a quite interesting lead for a plot line.

As I got to the end, I was starting to get a little dissapointed. I wasn't sure if there was going to be a Season 2, and it was trending towards an all-to-obvious, unbelievably malevolent bad guy. And really that is still true, but the seeds planted for a (SPOILER) Max descent into darkness arc has me really excited for where the story could go. While the main villains of history in this world might be obvious, the heroes and villains of the present might be much harder to distinguish.
