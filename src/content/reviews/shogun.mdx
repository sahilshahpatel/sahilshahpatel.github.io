_This review is in reference to the TV show Shogun produced for Hulu_

# Review in Summary
Shogun is a great show. It's masterfully produced and written, carrying a sense of gravitas that it maintains for the entire one-season story. The characters are compelling, their dynamics intriguing, and their development fascinating. It takes place in a super interesting time in Japanese history and tackles a story of colonization and exploitation expertly.

# In Depth Thoughts
Shogun very quickly characterizes its main characters. Toranaga and Mariko are both mysterious -- they have clear and strong personalities, but you get the sense that there is more thought behind their actions, and the prospect of learning their ulterior motivations keeps you engaged. John Blackthorne is the opposite. His ulterior motivations are shown to you from the very beginning -- he wants to wage war against the Catholics and end their "dominion" over Japan. However, his personality undergoes the greatest change in the story as he reacts to the entirely new world before his eyes.

Even the side characters are quite fascinating. Yabushige is the most emotive of the Japanese characters, and while is portrayed as a relatively intelligent general, he is also contrasted against the brilliant scheming of the political figures around him. Ochiba-no-kata is one of the most shrouded characters, though her actions have arguably the greatest effects. And finally Father Alivto provides some push-back on the notion that the Church is in Japan for entirely political or economic purposes. While that is certainly a huge deal to them and the story does not shy away from that fact, Alivto's internal conflict around these issues reminds us that the Portuguese were human too.

## An aside on foreign language TV
I want to quickly say that one of my favorite things about this show is how it handles multiple languages in the story. Since it takes place in Japan, it should be no surprise that in-universe the most common language is Japanese. Since the Portuguese have a large presence, Portuguese is also spoken a decent amount. English is spoken a bit at the very beginning and possibly a few times when Blackthorne is cursing to himself.

In the past, shows like this (made for American audiences) would have converted the Japanese into English and used subtitles for the Portuguese. However this show was also co-produced by Japanese people as well, and I think in large part because of there influence, Shogun decides not to do this. Instead, most of the show is in Japanese with subtitles. And instead they make the Portuguese English.

Personally I would have loved a show that kept the Portuguese Portuguese as well. I feel that the commitment to linguistic realism in this sense really helps the immersion of the story, especially because the story itself deals with linguistic barriers between people.

The way translation scenes are done in this show is particularly masterful, in my opinion. In scenes where we are meant to feel the distance created by requiring a translator, we the audience also experience the translation process. The Japanese will be given subtitles as it is spoken, but we will also hear the translator characters then speak the same sentiment in Portuguese. Not only does this create a specific "vibe" and aura around these scenes, but we also get some insight into the translators based on how they choose to translate certain sentiments.

Most of the scenes choose to do it this way, with the repetition of dialogue in order to transport the audience into the feeling of translated communication. However, the show also knows when this is not the best method for the scene. In Kiku's scene with Blackthorne and Mariko, they do a more traditional fade-out of the translation so that the audience can focus on the important monologue that Kiku gives. And actually, since Kiku is speaking in double entendre (or at least there is dramatic irony where her words are specifically meaningful to Mariko despite being directed at Blackthorne), in those moments the single speaker the show focuses on is Mariko and her Portuguese translation.

Overall I was really impressed with the way multiple languages was handled in this movie. Not only did it feel authentic and immersive, but they took the opportunity to use language and translation as an enhancement for the story as a whole.

## What happens when two cultures clash?
I think it's really easy to make mistakes when writing a story about two cultures colliding. There are countless examples of stories we complain about today. There are the classic tales of old where adventurers go out, meet "savages" and tame them. In these the "other" culture is portrayed as bad. The opposite doesn't feel great either though. In Pocahontas, for example, the native culture is painted in a good light (though it may be tropey, that isn't relevant to this point). But the story still feels bad because John Smith is the white savior who comes and respects there culture but also knows he must "civilize" them.

A more modern mistake would be to create a John Smith for both sides. An English/Portuguese character who is good at heart and is compassionate to the Japanese but must also save them from a threat they can't comprehend. And also a Japanese character who is sympathetic to the confused Englishman and doesn't disregard him as the others do. On its face, Shogun does exactly this with Father Alivto and Mariko. But it has a few key elements which prevent this from being a mistake.

First, the Japanese are 100% capable of understanding the threat of the Portuguese. Do they realize it at first? No. But when it is brought to their attention, they do understand it. Of course they don't necessarily eliminate that threat over the course of the show, and from the real history we know that they were exploited for sure. But we can see that they sense this and are working against it, even if they don't quite succeed.

Second, Blackthorne does adapt to Japanese culture over time. He learns the language in bits and pieces, slowly adopts their clothing, is willing to try their food, etc. He even has a great scene where he finally meets up with his original sailing crew and is disgusted with the state of them, showing that his cultural expectations have changed. However, he isn't a convert entirely. He draws lines that are very reasonable for an Englishman. He never quite understand's Mariko's sense of duty and her way of valuing life and death. He is appalled at Ueijiro's death and curses the system that caused it. As he adapts to the Japanese culture, he doesn't lose his core values. He accepts and even appreciates some things, while also judging and despising others.

The handling of very distinct cultures and how they might react to each other was just very thoughtfully done. It felt real and nuanced, and there is a realistic amount of variance between characters as well. In this the show does amazingly.

## A show that knows when to end
My last praise of this show will focus on its plot. Early on you are promised quite a lot in this story. Blackthorne wants to take down the entire Catholic church in Japan, and you expect that to be his arc. Toranaga wants to either take over Japan or restore the power of the Heir (depending on who you believe) and you expect that to be his arc. These are the two main plot arcs of the story, and yet \[SPOILERS\] neither comes to pass in the end. Despite this, the tension is maintained throughout and the pacing feels perfect. The conclusion is not anti-climactic -- rather, you finally see through a layer of Toranaga. Not enough to understand him fully, but enough to see his desires more clearly.

I love so much that the show ends with no setup for a further season. Early on you are lead to believe that it is Japan itself that will go through crazy changes over the course of the story. But by the end you realize that the greatest change happened in the people, and that political and societal change happens very slowly, of course. Shogun is the story of how the change starts, not how it continues and certainly not how it ends. And that's a beautiful thing.
