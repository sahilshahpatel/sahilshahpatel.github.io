# First Impressions
I initially watched this show after a couple of recommendations which focused on how creative the world building and alien design was. Because of that, I didn't expect too much from the narrative necessarily, so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it and loved both the visuals and narrative equally!

I was quite close to giving this an S, but without it being finished and so without having experienced the closing of the storylines and the climax of emotions that would be, I don't think I can put it there yet. But season one alone definitely sets itself up for that tier should it be continued by Netflix.

The story follows three separate groups to start, which is a story structure I've always loved. Each group is having a profoundly different experience on the planet, and that combined with their unique personalities makes each one's survival story so individually interesting. In combination they round out the storytelling of what it is to survive. What is connection vs. isolation? When does individual resolve fail? What is the value of curiosity and an open mind? All of these questions and more are explored by the characters of each group.

# Detailed Thoughts
Ok, all of the above was relatively vague, so let's dive into some details. Ursula is (so far) the least flawed, most relatable character. She serves as the anchor and ideal for the others (in the audience's mind). Sam feels similar until we learn about his past and how his controlling "management style" if you will caused some problems. Azi is self isolating, and so putting her in the plot line with semi-robotic life accents that trait of hers well. And Kamen is going through the ringer, in a way that makes him sympathetic even though he's otherwise the most easily disliked character in the story.

The writing around Levi was particularly good, I thought. She always speaks like a robot, but does slowly say more random and human things. And in particular her movements are so well done. She hesitates just enough to tell the audience that she herself doesn't know exactly why she is doing what she is doing, but you understand that it just feels right to her.

And then let's talk about Kris. When she was first introduced I really didn't expect her to turn out the way she does. But it's quickly apparent that she's quite manipulative and arguably abusive. Ultimately she is the most selfish character by far. Her bad actions contrast against Kamen's because they feel cold and calculated compared to Kamen's almost pathetic motivations.

As of writing, only one season of this show was released before being cancelled by HBO. Which is really a shame considering how well this season sets up its characters and stories. Often shows have a weaker first season as they work out the kinks and solidify for themselves who their characters are. Scavenger's Reign skipped that warmup period entirely, and it would be a real shame to not be able to see the conclusion to the story.
