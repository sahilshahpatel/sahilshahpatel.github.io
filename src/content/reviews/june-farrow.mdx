The following review will begin without spoilers but will contain them at points. You will be warned ahead of time :)

# Review In Summary
_The Unmaking of June Farrow_ is such a great book. It has a great central mystery, intriguing character dynamics and dramatic scenes, the perfect touch of romance, and even a bit of sci-fi-esque complexity to consider afterwards. This is exactly the type of story I love reading. It has an interesting (and at times convoluted) plot but feels very character driven. And despite technically being fantasy, it reads a lot more like realistic fiction to me.

# Spoiler-Free Review
The hard part about writing a spoiler-free review for this book is that the premise itself is a bit of a spoiler. The inside flap itself comes just up against the line of spoiling it. And I actually think that's fine -- it's not essential to go in not knowing the premise. But it is fun, and I'll explain why in this first section.

Young chooses a story structure that I've really come to love in mystery novels. In this structure, there are really two mysteries. At the beginning you have the mundane truth: Farrow women are cursed and go a little crazy over the course of their lives. Since you know it's a story and can't be so simple you are left with two questions: why? and "crazy" in what way specifically? The first section of any novel has to set a lot of groundwork for the rest of the story. And by using this structure you can imbue that groundwork with an intrigue of its own. The first few chapters are an encapsulated mystery of their own focused on those two questions.

I love this story structure because it adds an extra level of intrigue and warms up your mystery muscles to prepare you for the true mystery of the story. And like any good book the central mystery of _The Unmaking of June Farrow_ coallesces the plot mystery of "how did X happen" (X for spoiler prevention); many dramatic threads like "how was character A involved", or "what choice will character B make now", or "why has character C been acting this way the whole time"; and finally the romatic thread as well. All of these coming together at the end in the perfect climax is just the cherry on top of a book that already sucks you in like quicksand.

## Why I love June
Another reason I loved this book was because I find its main character June so relatable. She feels very grounded, and she has moments on both sides of every stereotype spectrum. Is she strong and capable of defending/handling herself? Yes. But she also has moments where things are too much and she needs help. Is she rigid and stubborn? Absolutely, but you understand early on why she is that way, and you can see the very human cracks in her rigid facade. Does she have to choose between two men in the romantic subplot? Yes, but the choice is so much more than that in a way that does not feel arbitrary at all.

June is also older than most main characters (given that most of my reading has been YA fiction). She's about 10 years older than I am (at the time of reading), which was actually really nice. Through the story she reflects on the actions of her elders and her younger self (and others younger than her). The perspective she has is both mature and in some ways naiive, which is exactly how most of us are in our 20s and 30s (or so I'm told). Watching her reckon with people she loves making decisions she does not agree with or understand felt so realistic.

# Spoiler Time
Ok, the rest of my thoughts can't really be put on paper without addressing the spoiler of the premise. I will not fully spoil the main mystery or the ends of any of the other narrative threads, but further sections will spoil more and more as this review continues.

So... she's a time traveler. The younger and older people she is judging? Yes there are other characters too, but it's mostly herself who she judges, and that's awesome! Her central choice? To stay or to leave. The main mystery? A knot at the center of her family's history with deep character implications.

In this way, the book reminds me of _Wrong Place Wrong Time_, another time travel novel that reads more like realistic fiction because the time travel is used only as a device to allow the main character to examine their own past more closely. In June's case she travels to the past, but is presented with a future version of herself who has made decisions she cannot comprehend. As she untangles the mystery of her own past, the town, and her family, June begins to understand the situation her future self was in, and the logic behind her actions.

## Depiction of trauma
This section will involve another level of spoilers. I would not continue before reading the book yourself.

The story of Nathaniel, Susana, and Caleb is an absolute tradgedy. Nathaniel is easy to hate, and Caleb appears that way too. But in the end Caleb is much more gray and interesting than first appearances suggest. Susana too is not just an abused wife, but a complex depiction of victimhood in her love for Nathaniel. I found this portrayal to be so well-written. It's intriguing because you don't know exactly how it happened for most of the book, and it feels real and complex once the full story is finally revealed. In the end you feel bad for everyone involved, which I think suits the story well.

## Disecting the time travel
As I mentioned, the time travel is really a narrative device to allow June to explore her own past tangibly. That being said, towards the end of the story you are told more about its internal logic, and it leaves a decent amount of room for thought. I'm left with two questions that I still haven't figured out:

1. When exactly did the timelines split? The narrative structure suggests that Nathaniel and Susana started the whole mess, but Esther also knows about the time travel, so it had to have been split around her as well.

2. We're told that you cannot time travel to a time you have already been in. If you do so, you will cease to exist. So what happens if you go to the year before a time you have already been in and just live out that year? Specifically, June has gone back to 1951 and is presumably staying there for good. But she was raised in the 1990s, so what happens when she turns around 80 years old and is existing in the 1990s while she is born? Does she just disappear then?

I do love the small detail that Birdie says early on that it's wrong that June has seen the door many times already and hasn't gone through it. "That's not supposed to be how it works" she says. This is because she expects to guide older June as she sets her plan in motion. But the whole point is that Annie will not have to live with the curse, so in actuality her task is to guide younger June as she reconstructs that plan from the fragments left by her other self.

Margaret/Gran has a similar moment where she doesn't want to say anything because older June told her not to. It's not clear to her at first that this being younger June means her job is done in some way. Or anyways, the final part of the plan happens only one year after it started, but the middle section of the plan takes place afterwards in the many years when Gran raises June as a child.

## Final thoughts
Though I picked apart the time travel a bit there, I should stress that I don't actually think it's that important. The time travel mostly exists for narrative purposes, and it serves that purpose impeccably. This story has just the right amount of twists and turns to keep you engaged. The characters feel so real in a way that grounds the fantasy premise, and it all comes together in an amazing climax that will not disappoint.

S tier ratings are reserved for things I find almost life-changing. Stories I will remember forever. I don't think _The Unmaking of June Farrow_ is that, but it's an absolutely excellent book that I would easily recommend to almost anyone. It slots in easily at the highest part of A+ tier, and I hope by now I've convinced you to give it a try!
