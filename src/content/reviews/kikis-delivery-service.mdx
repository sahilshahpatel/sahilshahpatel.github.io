I have a few different types of favorite Ghibli movie. Howl's Moving Castle is the one I've seen the most, Secret World of Arrietty is the one I remember most in theaters, and Whisper of the Heart is the one I think is "best".

But before Whisper of the Heart took it's place, Kiki's Delivery Service held the spot at the top for me. I really like this movie, and I think it's a great example of what Ghibli does best. Kiki's story is one of coming of age. She is sent to live on her own for a year working as a witch. As a country girl now in a big city, she feels ostracized at first trying to make friends. Even as she starts to make connections, she still struggles to figure out what she wants out of life. Her central conflict is about finding a source of passion -- why is she training as a witch? What does she do it for? What will keep her going?

Studio Ghibli is so good at nailing the whimsy and uncertainty of adolescence. In all their movies, young children (often girls), try to find their way in life. They struggle with the same things that we do every day. But a crucial element they usually have is the support of people around them, and a whimsy to their life that they just need to reclaim. That's what makes the stories so heartwarming -- the audience can see the joy in Kiki's life, and they just have to wait for her to find it again.

# Thoughts on the Story
I've mentioned before that Ghibli movies tend to end very differently than Western movies. They don't have to come to as solid a conclusion -- they are often ambiguous and meant to evoke a new beginning rather than give closure. Kiki's Delivery Service is no different in this respect. Kiki has made some connections in the city, and the epilogue indicates that she has made friends even outside of the main characters. But she likely still will struggle with some of the same feelings over time. She's reached a new point of confidence, but it doesn't mean that it will be smooth sailing from here on out. As it's a key metaphor in the movie, it's important to note that it's unclear if Jiji will ever speak again.

This kind of ambiguity can be really cool, but probably isn't my favorite, so perhaps I'm a little biased. In this case, I think it would work if more groundwork was done earlier. In particular, Tombo is a criminally underdeveloped character. For him to take part in the finale and be an important source of her passion (or at least represent some concept that she has passion for), he really needed to be more fleshed out in my opinion. As the movie is, we really have no reason to like him in particular. He seems nice enough, even if a little overbearing, but Kiki doesn't ever have a real reason to like him. In fact, with a modern perspective on gender dynamics you could even say he is a little creepy.

The parts that do work really well are Asuko and the Madame (baker Grandma). They are kind-hearted characters who look at the adolescent struggles of Kiki with compassion and give her the support she needs to work through it. Asuko's husband and a few other adults occupy this space well. Ursula (the artist) is somewhere in between. She is younger than the others and can relate more closely to Kiki, but she's certainly past adolescence, and so still acts as a role model. Ursula works so much better because her character is much more developed than Tombo's. While they both appear in the story a bit out of the blue, Ursula gets much more meaningful moments with Kiki that allow her to have more real impact on the story.

# Overall Rating
A lot of my complaints about this movie are ones I have for most Ghibli movies. But as I said in the beginning, what Ghibli always does well shines unbelievably bright in this movie in particular. It was my favorite for a while for a reason, and it does hold a special place in my heart. Most Ghibli movies are going to be A tier just for this alone, and Kiki's certainly is there, plus a bit of a nudge up.
