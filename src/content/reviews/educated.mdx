I am blown away by this book. You think you know the story when you read the reviews, but you find out quickly how wrong you were. And just when you think you've figured out the new "point of the story", you find out you're wrong again.

Tara Westover has a brilliant writing style, effortlessly mixing the no-nonsense language of the mountain with the lush prose of a renowned writer without letting one compromise the other.

The book is about family trauma, it's about religion, it's about culture and perspective and abuse and it's about education.

I've always been a fan of fiction (and not nonfiction) because I held the belief that most truths in life are better revealed through stories crafted for that purpose than by any true tale. But Educated has made me realize that true stories also have a power in their raw realism. In the ups and downs that don't fit the plot outlines we learned in grade school. In the uncertainty, in the pain, and in the suspense that only the irrational people who surround us can provide.

I honestly don't know how to review this book. It's so varied in what it is, and there are so many separate reasons I loved it. So I'll just say, do yourself a favor and read it.
