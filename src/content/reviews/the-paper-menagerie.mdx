The Paper Menagerie is probably my favorite short story I've ever read. I read it as part of my short story book club, and normally we focus on more philosophical, often sci-fi stories, so this one came as a nice departure from the norm. And actually, discussing this type of story is more what I tend to like anyways!

The Paper Menagerie is a typical second-generation-immigrant story about the children not understanding the parents. In plot, it's a lot like The Namesake, but as a short story The Paper Menagerie is a lot more concise and therefore it concentrates the emotions of the story in a way The Namesake cannot. It hit me in the feels in a similar way to Everything Everywhere All At Once as well. Really, I think I am just a sucker for this type of story, even though it's actually closer to my parent's experiences than it is my own. This short story is just an excellent encapsulation of those emotions, those struggles, those dynamics, and how we can grow through them.
