# My Preconceptions
I did not know Neon Genesis Evangelion (Evangelion for short throughout the rest of this piece) was an older anime. I knew it was popular because I'd heard the name quite a bit, but I had no knowledge of its plot, themes, or anything else really.

About a year before I actually watched it, Evangelion was brought up in conversation with me. I can't quite recall what this person said exactly, but in essence they dismissed the show and told me I wouldn't like it. Not that it was all bad, but that some specific element would turn me off. After having watched it, I think they were probably warning me about the sexualization, which, trust me, we'll get to later.

But then a few months ago I had a friend visit me and he brought up the show. We ended up watching the first couple episodes together. I wasn't entirely sold on them -- to be honest it felt like one of those pure action anime. I am not at all well versed in anime genres, but I've heard that's what "shonen" anime is about. I'm thinking Dragon Ball, Jojo, and some parts of Attack on Titan.

That kind of pure action -- "boy pilots super mech to delete the insanely powerful alien invaders" -- doesn't typically appeal to me, and on first inspection that's what this show seemed to be as well.

After a decent break, I got a little bored and decided I'd give it another shot since he spoke so highly of it. After starting again I watched it all the way through and then watched the finale movie. I have not watched the reboot movies but I have heard some commentary on them (more on that later). So here are my thoughts.

# The Full Review
## The mystery of the beginning
One thing I think Evangelion does well is establishing a "fake" vibe for the story. In the first few episodes you think the story is going to be about a little kid being drafted into some sort of military service and becoming the hero his people need him to be. This is a classic type of story that has wide appeal and is a good hook. What's so great about this early section is that it also successfully hints at the true themes of the story. Shinji's apprehension about his father is clear, and his melancholy and dispassion give some depth to a plot that might otherwise be simplistic.

While I do love this, I think the pacing is not very well managed. The mystery of the beginning is only interesting for too long, and the story fails to either keep the mystery going or start slowly unraveling it. And as I'll discuss later, I think the writing of the end suffers because it has so little time to pivot and explain the new direction.

## The sexism issue
I can't talk about this show without talking about sexism and the portrayal of women in anime. This is a problem I have with a lot of anime since the culture of it is widespread. Evangelion was fairly ok with this in the first few episodes, but with the arrival of Asuka it gets derailed fast. (As a quick aside, I'm very well aware that sexuality is supposed to be tied to the other themes of this story. I'll address that later.)

So, let's start with the early stuff. Misato is set up to be like an older sister or mentor to Shinji. Yet very early on we see Shinji's classmates oggling her for no plot-driven reason. They do the same with their female classmates during gym class in what really just amounts to an establishing shot. These are the kind of completely irrelevant and removable sexist scenes that are easy to find throughout anime and bother me the most.

Focusing on early scenes with Rei, I find her relationship with Shinji uncomfortably sexual and also very one-sided. When Shinji brings Rei her study guides, why does she come out naked? Why does he fall on top of her? Why does he accidentally fondle her? These things don't need to happen and make the whole scene unecessarily sexual. You are given the sense that Shinji is lonely, and having a scene were he can feel some semblance of attraction to someone in his social circle makes sense, but it doesn't have to be like this. And importantly, Rei is in a similar situation, felling isolated from her classmates as well, but the scene doesn't develop her or serve her character interests in any way.

Asuka is the next of Shinji's "love interests" (if you can call them that). She makes me even more uncomfortable than Rei. She is aggressively sexual, is obsessed with someone much older than her, makes comments about Misato, bullies Shinji into to kissing her at one point, and more. And all of this made me almost stop watching until it's finally revealed: her backstory. I won't go into it fully here, but Asuka has perhaps the most tragic backstory of all time. It's horrible -- traumatic to an extent that can't be described. And what happens with her father and step mother also explains quite well why her attachment style would be so toxic.

## Understanding the themes
It's at this point that I started to grasp the main theme of the story. In a word, it's about loneliness. It's about human connection, a lack of it, and how to feel whole again. When I think about the story like this, I actually love it so much. A story about lonliness and human connection wherein young children take up unreasonable responsibilities because they that in having a purpose they will feel good again.

I like that direction. I like that it gives reasons for some of the characters to feel so selfish, or arrogant, or toxic. It turns a simple action story into a deep and dark psychological reflection piece. Except that these themes don't stay correlated to the story, and they aren't wrapped up well at all.

## The conclusion of the story
As we get to the end we have so many unanswered questions. Who are the angels? What is SEELE? What is Gendoh doing, and why is the professor standing by him? Do the magi have anything to do with this? All of these questions are intriguing. I was watching these last few episodes with a lot of interest, hoping to see it all come together. But the answers to all of these questions either 1) don't come or 2) don't tie in to the main themes.

I think Evangelion tries to shove too much world building in to a couple final episodes (here I'm talking about the final TV episode and the conclusion movie together). When you need to reveal so much about the world in one go, it's important that all of it is tied together so that the audience can focus on the one single reveal that makes everything fall in to place simultaneously. Shows like Attack on Titan, for example, make you think you know the answer and then a single reveal recontextualizes it all. That kind of approach might have worked better here -- maybe we think we know that the angles are aliens, and the big reveal is that they are alternate humans or the progenitors of humans or whatever it's supposed to be (I was never really clear on that concept). In that world, the alternate humans plot line would have to connect thematically to our character-driven plotline of Shinji wanting to please his father and find human connection.

Unfortunately, I don't think these problems can be solved with just a re-ordering or a re-prioritization. Fundamentally the worldbuilding of Evangelion doesn't support it's themes, in my mind. The final TV episode goes on this manifesto-like rant about how humanity's main problem is a lack of connection, and the proposed solution is a unification of all human matter. Perhaps I am just missing the point here, but does that actually mean anything? Even metaphorically I think it's just nonsense. And the Angels and SEELE have nothing to do with this either, really.

And lastly, let's talk about the sexuality. The idea, I think, is that sex is the most natural way in which two humans connect, and has clear ties to themes of lonliness. I don't necessarily hate this, though I do think it's not necessary to hit the themes home. Our original sources of loneliness are parental neglect and lack of friendship (with Shinji, his father, and his peers). These two are more than enough, in my opinion, and focusing on the romantic/sexual form of loneliness only adds confusion and more elements to deal with.

## How I would change it
This section won't be complete, but I wanted to at least record the idea of it. I have always liked the idea of re-writing stories that have good thematic roots but whose executions could use some improvements. I am no writer, though, so I don't have complete ideas on the subject.

Primarily I would love a greater focus on drawing parallels between Shinji, Asuka, and Misato (and maybe Rei, but I'll get to that). In the original, the story is very focused on Shinji, and for the most part Asuka, Rei, and Misato are portrayed as options for him to form connections with (with a sexual connotation). I think this does the story a disservice, since it is meant to describe a universal struggle. I think it would have been much more interesting to see the ways in which loneliness can present itself:
- Shinji is classically depressed and has low self confidence
- Asuka projects confidence in attempt to hide her insecurities
- Misato seems fine outwardly, but forms shallow relationships and is afraid of intimacy because of her traumas
- Rei completely disconnects, viewing herself as less than human and not worthy of connection

A better ramp-on for the story, then, could be that Shinji arrives and is consumed by his own depression and ideas, but slowly comes to realize that they are all feeling the same way, even if they are presenting differently. In this version, I think SEELE is cut entirely, and so is the professor. Gendoh should also be struggling with loneliness, probably in connection to having lost his wife which should then connect to the angels and the mystery of who they are. How exactly that works is something I'm not sure about yet. In a modern era with society questioning the value and purpose of AI, I think the magi could be better integrated too, perhaps with the tangential question of what makes something human? Perhaps the angels are more human than the magi, or maybe the magi (being Ritusko's mother, in some sense) also feel this loneliness. I don't have concrete ideas on this either, but I did feel like the magi were quite disconnected from the rest of the story in the original.

# Final Thoughts
Neon Genesis Evangelion is a fascinating show. It has a good hook, an even better thematic setup, and a great air of mystery that makes it so entertaining. Unfortunately, it really fumbles the ending, failing to tie any of the themes to any of the plot lines. Not only do they not connect, but there are many parts of the mystery which aren't ever actually explained (SEELE, what happened to Shinji's mother, exactly what the Second Impact was, etc.). All of these elements and failings of the conclusion end up poisoning the potential of the premise. Add that to the personal ick-factor of how the story treats its women and its over-sexualization and you get a C- rating.
