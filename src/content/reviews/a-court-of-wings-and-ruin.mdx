When I began the ACOTAR series I was told that number three was many people's favorite. I think because I'm a guy and because I like fantasy, it was thought that I'd enjoy the political thriller bent of this book more than the others which focus more on the romance aspect. In the end, though, I think Mass is much better at writing romance than she is fantasy or politics, and so this was probably my least favorite of the three (though not by far).

My main problem with this book is that by diving into the politics and world building, Mass shines a spotlight on all the plot holes, conveniences, and vagueries that hold the series together. The pattern I kept on seeing was that every time we needed a villain or monster, or every time we needed Feyre to recall a moment of strength, it was always a call back to the same set of things: the Middenguard Wyrm, the Adder, the Bone Carver, etc. Each of these beings felt conjured for the moment when they first were shone, and thus felt entirely disconnected from the moment when they were called back to. The first moment that really highlighted this to me was when Feyre showed the Children of the Blessed at the wall some nightmares and it was just a list of every bad guy we'd ever seen. And it comes back even stronger at the end with the "avengers assemble" moment except it makes literally no sense for some of these characters to be there and on the same team.

The first book of the series especially was able to keep me interested because I cared about Feyre as a person (and also Tamlin and Lucian to a lesser extent) and wanted to see them be happy. As the fantasy elements ramped up, I could still hold on to the human story at the center of it all. Even in book two, the character focused stories of the Court of Dreams held things together. But in this book there is really no such story. The focus is entirely on the world and its politics, and none of that is any good.

Ultimately, I'm glad I read this series to at least expose myself to a new genre and give it an honest shot. I actually think the premise of romantasy as a genre could really work for me, but the current set of authors out there don't seem to be writing it the way I want it. That being said, reading this has made me more curious about what types of romance I do like in my books, and so I at least appreciate it for having induced that reflection! As a standalone book though, this is really not good, nor is the series as a whole.

P.S. After finally completing the trilogy, here is my compiled list of Maas' writing ticks (just for fun):
- "Once, twice" (a classic, and the one I was warned about but noticed the least)
- Double and chains e.g. "color and light and shadow" (the one I noticed the most)
- Using "that/those" where "the" would suffice (the one I noticed most in this book, but probably her most common actually)
