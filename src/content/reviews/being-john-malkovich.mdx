*Being John Malkovich* is a movie I'd heard of a few times and always seemed like a cult classic film. The premise is obviously a little absurd, and you can tell it will be a heavy concept film and a bit artsy. All those things are actually things I like, so I was interested to see what this film had to offer.

The beginning of the movie started out quite rough for me. I could enjoy the absurdism of Craig joining the company and found a lot of that funny. But as soon as he meets Maxine I started getting the ick and it did not go away. There's a lot of creepiness and just horrible expressions of the worst parts of masculinity in this movie, and they aren't really *the point* of the film. They just exist because its a 90s movie and that's how it is. In the end this felt like watching a lot of anime in the sense that you just have to try and ignore that feeling of disgust and judge the movie on it's other merits. But it warrants mentioning for sure.

So how is the rest of the movie? Well, good but not great. The main idea of the movie (in my mind anyways) is what it means to control people. There's a pivotal scene where Maxine says that Craig controls Malkovich, but that she controls Craig and therefore she kind of controls Malkovich. While the tunnel into a mind is obviously fiction and no one in the real world can control people the way Craig does, what Maxine is doing is absolutely real, and that's what the story is really talking about.

While that main theme was very interesting, I think the rest of the movie didn't support it particularly well. The plot with Dr. Lester should be relevant to the main theme given that its the sort of reason for the premise existing. You'd think he'd have his own story of control and what it means. But he doesn't really, and in fact there are a lot of weird plot hole and/or questions that come from him and his gang of friends that want to go together into a vessel.

Lotte is the other main character. She has an interesting moment early on where she basically realizes that she's trans, and that line of thinking and implication of the mind tunnel is super fascinating! But the movie doesn't really go anywhere with that (for the 90s I'm not very surprised), nor does it tie that back in to any other story line. Because of that Lotte is interesting but doesn't actually help the movie add up to more than the sum of its parts in any way.

Overall Being John Malkovich is a weird and funny movie that definitely has a market out there. I feel like I was about half of the market -- I like artsy weirdness to some degree but I'm not all in on it. It delivers fairly well to that market, but it misses the mark when it comes to delivering a well-designed message with clarity.
