In this novel is a really interesting world with lots of ideas about how the future might unfold and about human nature, greed, and power. What it lacks, in my opinion, is a story. Arguably this is the story of Thailand in this future dystopian world, but even that is not really fully told. At times throughout I thought it would be the story of Anderson, Hock Seng, the titular Emiko, or even maybe Jaidee and Kanya. But it is none of those really, and in that way it disappointed me.

The praise for the author on the back indicates that Bacigalupi is a short story writer and that rings very true. The type of story that this is fits closely with what works well in short stories. And all the elements I feel like it is missing are ones not as necessary in a shorter medium.

I have to say that The Windup Girl has a fascinating world. If you like a grungy dystopia, Bacigalupi does a great job setting and keeping his tone throughout. The ideas and themes of the novel are very clear, even if they are not tied together in a way that was narratively satisfying to me. And so this book is certainly not a bad one. It takes a hard look at humanity and in asking what motivates us, it finds dark, dark answers that will give you much to think about for a long time after. Ultimately, it's a good book that could have been great. Certainly worth reading, but perhaps not worth lauding, at least for me.
