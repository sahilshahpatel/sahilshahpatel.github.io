Iron Widow is a fun YA read. The premise engages you from the start, and the ideas have a lot of promise. Unfortunately, the execution is weak, which drops its favorability in my opinion.

The easiest comparison for Iron Widow has to be Hunger Games. The stories are similar on so many levels. The YA-ness, the premise of young people being forced into violence, the love triangle -- all of that and more. The truth is, having read Hunger Games in middle school and having read Iron Widow as an adult, it's hard to say if one is really better than the other. I'm certainly biased because of the time in my life when I read them, but I feel way more fondness for Hunger Games than I feel for Iron Widow.

# The Good
But let's start with some praise. Iron Widow is definitely entertaining. Especially at the beginning I just kept wanting to read more. I was really interested in knowing what would happen next, and that to me is a hallmark of a good book.

There are two things that engage the reader early on in this book. The first is the characters. Zetian is instantly likeable as a protagonist fighting against oppression. Her cause makes sense to the reader and we are immediately sympathetic. She also has the "country girl wants to leave her terrible town" thing going, which is another archetype that's easy to attach to. And finally the presence of Yizhi adds some mystery. He is intriguing, but we're not sure whether or not to trust him and want to find out more.

The second hook is the world. Qi powers are cool, spirit pressure is interesting (although I have my qualms), Chrysalises are epic, Hunduns as aliens go are fairly unique, the "gods" are a complete mystery, and the society as a whole is an archetypal dystopia. These elements are described early, but the exact notion of what they are is vague, so the reader is encouraged to continue on to find out.

All of this groundwork is really good, and carries a lot of potential. But as I alluded to earlier, the execution is where it falls short.

# Shortcomings
## A quick aside
Before we get into my main gripes, a quick aside on the powers. I don't have a preference on hard vs. soft magic systems. Both can be cool, they just need to be used in different ways. I do hate "power level" stuff though, and spirit pressures are that exactly. Not everyone will agree with me, and that's fair, but as soon as they started measuring in numbers I knew I wasn't going to care about it.

Qi powers are fine, but they end up still feeling like shonen anime generic power blasts, so I feel like a lot of potential was lost there. Spirit metal is cool, but relatively unused outside of Chrysalises.

So the magic system, while initially cool, felt pretty underwhelming. In the end this novel was like [Neon Genesis Evangelion](evangelion) where you can imagine the mechs just being machines that must be piloted, and you don't expect any magic outside of the mechs.

## Execution
My main problem with this novel is that its ideas aren't well explored by its plot and characters. Zetian just goes back and forth too quickly with too little depth for me to really feel like her story illuminates anything interesting about the problems she struggles with.

Something I often wonder is what makes something "preachy". Sometimes a book has something to say and that message is just so well integrated in the story that it feels natural. Sometimes it is the opposite, and the story contorts around itself to prove some point, and in the process loses its impact. It's hard for me to find an example of a book that does exactly what Iron Widow is trying to do but better. But I have some analogous ones perhaps. [When Women Were Dragons](when-women-were-dragons) can feel preachy at times, but as a whole addressed feminism in a way more integrated way. [Yellowface](yellowface) isn't about feminism, but it addresses cultural appropriation very well in my opinion. [Educated](educated) is non-fiction, but it's story of the oppression of women feels so much more real and gritty than Iron Widow.

Let me address a few specific topics. (SPOILERS ahead).

First, her family. There is a plot line about reconciliation (which, SPOILER, ends in very much no reconciliation). I actually quite like the idea of this -- the potential of it. People who resist norms to which their families are still beholden often have to make hard decisions about how much they are willing to sacrifice for their ideology. In the case of Zetian who has a negative relationship with her family, she has to decide if it even is a sacrifice, and other norms about family and what it is supposed to mean make that determination difficult. That being said, the book doesn't really explore this struggle at all. She hates her family, then someone tells her to try and imagine something better for them so she does, and then someone tries to manipulate her through her family and she decides she doesn't care that much after all. The changes she goes through in this are fairly instant, which is where the execution was failed in my opinion.

Let's look at the revenge porn black mail thread. It faces a similar problem where the author clearly wanted to make a point, but in doing so erased the possibility of an interesting character journey. Zetian is initially embarrassed by this bargaining chip. Then Zhao writes her pre-considered monologue about the absurdity of someone blackmailing you with your own body (which is a decent monologue by the way, I'm not hating on it intrinsically). And then Zetian just stops being embarrassed. The instant change there again robs us of the potential for an interesting _journey_ around this idea. At the very end when it's brought up again, it's even more jarring that she seems embarrassed by it since we got a strong indication that she wasn't earlier. Now don't get me wrong -- I know that it's natural to convince yourself of something in the moment and still doubt it later. But realism is not necessarily correlated with good story telling, and that kind of behavior in particular is unsatisfying in a story.

For another point, let's consider her arc with Shimin. The general idea for this arc is
- Everyone knows Shimin is an evil psychopathic murderer
- Zetian is forced to mind meld with him. She sees a lot of horror there but also empathizes some
- Zetian grows closer to Shimin as she realizes that the rumors about him are not entirely true and that the demons he has are ones he is fighting, not ones he surrenders to

Unfortunately, this arc isn't realized very well. Early on she has a weird early spike of compassion at their first meeting when she asks if his family deserved it, he says yes, and she says "I believe you". That moment happens way too early in the arc and doesn't really make too much sense. Then as she should be more compassionate she still claims to hate him for a long time, and still seems to have this notion that the next time they go to battle only one of them can survive. I don't really understand where this comes from -- it feels like Zhao is using it as a engine of tension that will prolong the middle phase of the arc. But it feels very contrived to me.

## What comes next
The conclusion of Iron Widow is somewhat mystifying. So much happens so fast, without real closure for a lot of characters in my opinion. Their analyst "supporter" (I forget his name) always felt really weirdly on the fence to me, and I think he just dies offscreen. Conflict with other Chrysalises is sort of brushed over. The emperor just takes a back seat for a while and that's hand-waved away with "he's still kinda sick and therefore tired". All of this just leads to a really unsatisfying conclusion for me. What the author focuses on instead of tieing up storylines is expanding to new ones about the gods and the Hunduns. This to me is another example of scope creep in stories and how it can overshadow the important story elements of the here and now in favor of a grand tomorrow.

# Conclusion
Overall, I found Iron Widow to be quite a fun and entertaining read. It's world is pretty interesting, and it has some controversial ideas to discuss as well. However, the execution of the discussion is poor, and the pacing of the plot is too fast to allow for a lot of connection with the characters. Finally, the end of the novel is just not satisfying. All that adds up to a B-tier book. It has some good elements and I could see why others might like it, but I came away feeling disappointed and without any drive to recommend this book to anyone really.
