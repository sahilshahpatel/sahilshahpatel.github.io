Andor season two is a really great follow-up to season one, especially given that it was tasked with seamlessly joining season one and the movie Rogue One. That being said, I've heard many say that season two is better than season one, and on that I'll have to disagree.

_Very minor spoilers ahead_

Season two was released in four batches of three episodes each. In between each batch was a one year in-universe time skip. This was a good decision given the goal of connecting straight into the movie, but it makes the season feel much more like a montage than a cohesive story about individuals. The most obvious comparison is to [_Arcane_](arcane) which also did time skips between it's acts. However, I feel the two shows did their time skips quite differently. In Arcane (season one anyways) the story is still very much about personal character journeys, even with the time skips. In Andor S2, it feels like the individual character journeys take a backseat to the story of the world in a big way. While S1 made us care a lot about Mon Mothma and the sacrifices and risks she was taking, S2 finishes up that arc abruptly and with little detail. Instead we are left with a light impression of how she might feel, and instead her story is used to highlight how the rebellion itself is changing.

This is not necessarily a bad thing, just a different thing. For me personally, I've always loved personal character journeys a lot, and so S2 suits my tastes less than S1. Besides Mon Mothma, I felt that Bix was robbed of a good story twice in two different moments (Gorst and her goodbye), Lonnie's concerns with the rebellion would have been cool to see over time, Syril's transition into his role in S2 interests me (although his arc in S2 overall is quite good), Wilmon has an interesting moment with Saw but it's never expanded on, etc. There are just so many moments that have so much potential but were skipped over for the sake of the montage. And despite the quality of the final product, I can't help but be sad for that missed potential.

Season 2 is at its best during the Gorman revolution. That arc is introduced and developed well, and its ending has a lasting impact on the rest of the show. My second favorite was probably the first arc focusing on Mon Mothma and immigration politics. That arc was great it the moment, but it only got passing references throughout the rest of the show and therefore didn't feel as integrated as I would have liked.

But you can't talk about Andor without talking about the moment in which it was made. As the world seems to be backsliding in the direction of authoritarianism, Andor is quite obviously commenting on issues of our time. To have released this season during the beginnings of Trump's second term, while we're all grappling with the ensuing chaos and crisis of ethics, that makes this show something special to all who watch it right now. What I love is that this returns Star Wars to its roots with commentary on the political reality of its time. And I think it executes that commentary many many times better than the originals too.

In my mind, Andor season two does not surpass season one. But it does build on it, take it in a satisfactory (even if not my favorite) direction, and execute on the original themes brilliantly. As a whole, Andor is absolutely S tier. By itself, I think S2 would normally be A+, but it attains S tier because of the timeliness of its message.
