# Review in Full
Look, I'm a sucker for a coming of age story, and I love the anime visual style and this movie in particular is just beautiful, so for me, this movie was probably A tier as far as enjoyment. But I also love analyzing stories and seeing how they work, and the more I interrogated this movie the less cohesive it seemed, so I have to drop it to B tier.

## The positives
Let's start with the positives though. Suzume is a super relatable character right off the bat. She's not necessarily crazy adventurous, but she isn't scared either, and the way she initially reacts to Souta and then doubles back made me like her from the start. As she's thrown into this crazy world her optimism and confidence are fun to watch.

The best part of the movie for me, though, was Souta. Personifying inanimate objects is one of my favorite things you can do in animation, and Souta the three-legged chair is just so good. It's comedic for sure, but the animation is also very fluid and communicative, so he doesn't feel sidelined as a character either. This to me is the best-executed part of the movie.

## Overanalyzing Daijin
Ok, now on to the downsides. I have to first give a mention to an almost universal annoyance with anime for me -- the love interests often feature really large age gaps. Why is Souta in graduate school? Why not high school like Suzume, or at least early undergraduate so the age gap isn't so big?

But that's more of a personal gripe, so I'll move on to the structural gripes. My main question here is: who is Daijin and why do they do anything that they do? About halfway through the movie, my friend and I looked at each other and said "Daijin is definitely Suzume's Mom from the Ever After". I thought this would work well because it would explain why Daijin wanted Suzume's love. And the story would end with Daijin realizing that her daughter had a life without her now and that trying to cross back from the Ever After was causing big problems in the living world, including for her daughter. So she would re-sacrifice herself to become the keystone.

In this scenario, Suzume can see the worm because her family is also one of Closers, removing the plot convenient "special door" which you can go through. It would better explain Daijin, and perhaps could have linked Suzume and Souta together by connecting that with Souta's grandfather's "old friend" also being a keystone.

Ok back to the actual plot of the movie. So Suzume's mother is in the end revealed to actually have died in an earthquake. Daijin has no particular motive to do anything, we need a plot convenient "special" door for Suzume to even see the Ever After, the "old friend" thing is never explained, and it all doesn't really make too much sense.

I actually looked up "Suzume explained" to see if we had just missed something, but found no explanations that satisfied me.

## Final thoughts
To end on a positive note, the main theme of the power of connections with other people was quite powerful to me. I also really liked Suzume's conversation with her Aunt after they fought. It showed a really mature handling of that heavy topic and just worked so well.

Overall I did enjoy the movie and would recommend it. But I don't think there was too much thought in constructing its plot to serve the narrative and themes. It's not very internally consistent, but in a way that doesn't ruin a casual watching of the movie at all.
