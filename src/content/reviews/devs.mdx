# Outline (to distill later)
- do I just not underestand quantum mechanics?
- debroglie or whatever = determinism, fully. Does that exist? Need to research that interpretation
- many worlds... how does that work for simulation exactly? If you're going backwards it's theoretically possible to find the version of the wave function collapse that causes a simulation to rewind back to a known state. But if you don't know the historic state and you are trying to derive it, how do you know which version of the collapse to take? Many worlds says that all version happen, so which one is the right one? Forest brings this up to say Amaya would be fake, but really it would be so much more drastic than that. No matter how tiny a step back you try and take in time and your simulation would be meaningless garbage, no way to pick anything certain. Going forward would be straight up impossible because it would diverge equally as quickly
- How does compression work here? They gloss over it but theoretically the simulation contains "big data" -- i.e. all the data of every particle everywhere in the universe. But if the simulation exists within itself because it's a perfect replication of the world, then that sort of breaks everything because it has to compress the data about the world into some finite amount of particles and then within that finite amount there is another, smaller finite amount that encodes the simulation data of the sim within the sim, and so on ad infinitum until you must inherently be able to compress all data about the universe into nothing. So that makes no sense
- And then let's ignore compression. Say it can contain all the data about everything in the universe. Where did they get this data to start the simulation? They have some scenes of them scanning a rat or something but by their own admission there are particles in the air that could influence this. And particles much further away might influence those air particles which influence the rat. So theoretically in order to simulate the rat on to infinity you'd need absolutely complete information about the universe's state at some moment to progress it forward. The easiest version is that they know the state of the big bang some how or something, but they clearly say that they started from the present and can go backwards and forwards. But how could that possibly be true? How did they scan everything everywhere all at once to set the initial state of the simulation. By quantum mechanics itself they wouldn't be able to measure these things without collapsing the wave function which would do who knows what to the validity of the data

- I'm not a person who thinks sci-fi has to be 100% real. That's dumb, obviously we're going to break some known limitation or rules because that's the only way we project into the future. But I much prefer a sci-fi that says "hey, guess what, this thing is real, it can exist and you're not allowed to question it. Now let's see what that thing existing does to our characters and their perspectives". Devs arguably does that but it's "given" is a full simulation of the entire world which just makes so little sense that it breaks everything. It's not some small technology that one could imagine existing in a decade or something -- it's completely implausible and none of the characters question that and it took me out of it a bit

- Lily being a cryptologist is super weird. I thought it was going to be relevant but it's not. It's actually awkward at some parts because she should respond to things a certain way and doesn't, and sometimes they write her weird encryption lines and it's kinda cringe

- Overall I like the premise of this story though. I like the idea of Forest being driven to recreate Amaya. But as I watched it I started to have an expectation. I was hoping that the writers understood something about future-seeing in a predestination world. Inherently a person will always do what they see themselves doing. And so it must be impossible for a person to see the future and then want to change it (once the time comes). And so it would have been really cool to see a story written where we along with the main character find the future prediction proposterous and decide we want to break it. But as the rest of everything plays out we end up making the same decisions as we saw (and along the way they all make sense and are 100% in character). Ted Chiang writes some determinism stories kind of like this, but with a godly twist. It would have been cool to see something like that but less godly and more grounded.
- I did like the devs = deus thing, that was pretty clever IMO

- The end falls a little flat for me because I just don't get it. If Many Worlds is true, then why would Forest and Katie think they could know the future? If they can know their exact future it must only be because there is only one future, no? Setting that aside, Lily just "makes a decision". How?? Why?? Huh???? They just break their own rules at the end and say "forge your own path, kids!" like it's the moral of the story and that's a perfect ribbon with which to wrap this all up. Um... no. Just no. That doesn't make any sense, it's not internally consistent, and so it's not satisfying
- How do Forest and Lily exist in the "many worlds" at the end? I thought the simulation showed you the same future every time, and presumably the same past every time. So it was never established that the simulation processed all of the many worlds at all. So then why would Forest and Lily exist in all of them? Additionally, how can you just copy/paste Forest and Lilly's brains into some past date? That doesn't make sense. In the determinism world you cannot edit anything, cannot change it, because everything depends on everything else and so it would be physically impossible for Lilly to have those memories at that time. There shouldn't be a way to edit the state of the simulation in that way really other than setting a completely new universal state which how would you know how to compute that? I guess that goes back to the previous question about initial states and scanning and stuff.

- Man does Jamie get the short end of the stick here. They didn't break up because Lily was attracted to this new guy and decided to break up. If that's the case then _maybe_ it makes sense that once she realizes Sergei is "fake" that she goes back to Jamie. Even then that feels pretty bad. But we are told that she grew distant after getting her job at Amaya, that perhaps she thought Jamie wasn't good enough for her, not ambitious enough. And we get absolutely no resolution to that emotional plotline. In the main timeline she ends up sleeping with him the night before the end and I was just rooting for him to say no because she's in no way resolved that issue. He's basically being emotionally manipulated. And in the post-death paradise timeline she just goes and hugs him and he just hugs her back but when did she earn that? Why should I be rooting for them? Forest and his family are totally different than Lily and Jamie at the end, and it messes up the vibe I think they were going for

- B+ because it was pretty entertaining. It was suspenseful. The acting is good (except Lily, idk I didn't love her). The cinematography is excellent and the sound design is great too. I think it's good on the surface but I wasn't happy when I dug deeper, so it can't be an A but isn't that bad either. The analysis is similar to Suzume which was also a B+.
