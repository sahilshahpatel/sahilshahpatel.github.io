# Quick Review
Devs is a thought-provoking show about free will and the wild dreams of tech billionaires. The show is well shot and is entertaining, but it relies on a premise which doesn't work when considered with any scrutiny.

# Full Review
## A disclaimer on quantum mechanics
Ok I made a bold statement in saying that the premise "doesn't work when considered with any scrutiny". The truth is that I could totally be wrong about this because I am no expert in quantum mechanics. But I have two reasons for continuing with my analysis despite my credentials. First, I do have a basic understanding of the concepts so I don't think I'll be too far off. And second, this show hand-waves quantum mechanics a bit in an attempt to make the story digestible for common audiences. My conception of these concepts also match with the common conception, I believe, and so even if I am wrong I still believe the show fails to properly explain in that case.

## What is a simulation?
Simulations tend to be useful because we only need to simulate macroscopic effects. When simulating pool/billiards, we can store just the position and momentum of a ball to simulate the way in which it will bounce off another. If you do a full quantum simulation of anything you aren't simplifying at all. That means your simulation has to be as big as the real thing (or bigger, since your simulation logic isn't just encoded into the fabric of space and stuff). Think about in modern day, for example, how simulating molecular proceses takes huge computer resources. The same principle means that the simulation of a single multi-cellular organism would be a big task, let alone a human, or a country, or the planet, or the universe.

So a quantum simulation of everything doesn't make much sense. But, you know what? Sci-fi doesn't have to make sense. I'm ok with that. It necessarily bends and breaks rules in order to craft a good story and to make its points. What is important for sci-fi is to set up its own rules and stick to them. In this case, one of the important thematic realizations in _Devs_ is (SPOILER ALERT) that the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct. This make projecting a simulation into the past for future even more nonsensical. If you turn back the clock on many-worlds, how do you arrive precisely at _your_ history and not some random other-worlds' history? The same is true of the future -- the pilot wave interpretation removes the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics and so could theoretically be played forwards. But many worlds implies that there are infinite possible options for any probabilistic opportunity and all of them happen. So which one does this simulation choose as it predicts the future? The idea that you would be able to see anything with this is just ludicrous.

## Let's talk about the end (SPOILERS)
_Devs_ spends a lot of time telling you that the world is deterministic. In the end, it subverts this and decides it is not. But not in a universal way -- it's not like it was never deterministic and Forest and Katie were wrong the whole time. No, instead Lily is just the first human to ever make an "actual choice" somehow.

I hate this because I hate the "I am the only real consciousness" philosophy. _Devs_ ends up supporting this, telling Lily that she's special somehow and everyone around her is a robot. And in the very end, Lily and Forest are _actually_ the only "real" people, and everyone else is a simulation. It just feels like a weird choice for a story that was doing its determinism shtick pretty well before the end.

I must admit that I am biased here because I just really like other stories that have gone the other direction. Ted Chiang's stories often have a deterministic bent, but it is made peace with. The show _Dark_ also subverts its deterministic time travel premise but without making any one character special for no reason.

## A few more random thoughts
- Why is Lily an expert in encryption? This doesn't end up serving any purpose or lead to any epiphany. In fact she goes to other characters (Jamie) to help her crack her encrypted phone. There are a couple lines early on where she references her encryption expertise but they aren't plot relevant at all (as far as I can tell). Later she has one very on-the-nose encryption metaphor for something but it didn't really make sense to me and just seemed random
- Man does Jamie get the short end of the stick! It makes me mad that they never give any real explanation for Lily leaving him. It's implied that she just got too big for her britches when she got a job at Amaya, and that's a really interesting idea for a relationship, but then that goes nowhere. She doesn't develop from that at all. And Jamie just stays with her! And in the end Lily's happy ending is that she gets to be with Jamie, but Jamie's happy ending isn't really considered at all
- I did really like Devs = Deus. It's cheesy, sure, but it worked well for me

## Explaining the tier
I gave _Devs_ a B because it was pretty entertaining. It was suspenseful and the acting was good (except Lily who I didn't particularly love). The cinematography is excellent and the sound design is great to. All of that combines to make it a pretty good show on the surface. But I wasn't happy with what I found as I dug deeper. The plot doesn't hold up, nor do the thematic ideas have synergy with the character development.
