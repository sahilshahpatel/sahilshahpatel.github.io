Over the Garden Wall was hyped up to me a lot, and unfortunately I don't think I met expectations. That being said, it's still fun and enjoyable, just not as impactful as I was hoping it would be.

Let's start with the positives. The animation is nice, the characters are cute and relatable, and the mystery is good. I do think the show has a slightly slow ramp-up in that you don't really understand the mystery until at least 4 episodes in. But I view this almost as a movie -- it should be watched in one sitting and when done that way it feels just fine.

One element a lot of people seem to like are the songs. I do agree that they are kind of fun and quirky, and because the musical style is not one we hear a lot I do like them in a way. But I don't really feel like the songs add much to the show itself. They don't reveal our characters feelings particularly well and they don't show up at times where a song feels needed. Instead they are also a little quirky and weird in their placement within the story, and for that reason I didn't love them exactly.

My favorite element was the way in which (what I think is) the central mystery -- the Beast's lantern -- resolves itself. It's quite hard to make a satisfying ending to a mystery and I thought the revelation was excellent. It makes perfect sense and flowed well with the rest of the plot, yet it was not something I had thought of at all! Perhaps it was more obvious to others (it's not astoundingly complex), but I just wasn't thinking in that direction and so it was a really nice reveal to me.

What did I not like? Well, put simply I feel like the overall message and/or theme was just nonexistent. There's somewhat a theme of never giving up, but that doesn't really tie in to the end. There's somewhat a theme of appreciating those around you rather than getting annoyed at them, but that doesn't really tie in to the end. There's somewhat a theme that Wirt needs to gain some confidence and stop his anxiety from running free, and that one does actually tie in to the end but the progression of that character trait doesn't really happen as part of the plot.

And yes, I just have a special dislike for stories of awkward boys wanting to ask out their crushes. Wirt thinks Jason is going to ask out Sara before him, and decides he's the "better package" and gives up. When characters think along these lines it always frustrates me because it implies to me that they want to ask out the person not because of a two-sided view of a relationship but because of a one-sided one. And I know that's part of the point (Wirt is too anxious to realize that Sara likes him too), but it's also just a way-too-prevalent misogynistic perspective and I feel like there are so many other ways to write romantic tension.

So overall it's a quite enjoyable show. The atmosphere is great, so I understand why people watch it every fall. But the story itself is very much like a set of vignettes. When they do try to tie things in together at the end, it doesn't amount to much. And the element they stress most (Wirt and Sara) is something I personally find unique annoying. Judged as a normal story, I think this would be a B+ at best. But in the context of a family annual autumn watch, I'll bump it up to an A-.
