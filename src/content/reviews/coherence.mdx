Coherence is a cool movie that might normally be a regular A tier, but it's unique style and relativity bump it up to A+.

Ever since Marvel's Endgame and its stark contrast to Into the Spiderverse and Everything Everywhere all at Once, I've loved watching multiverse/parallel universe movies and thinking about how that premise adds to the themes. Coherence is fairly basic in its explorations of the themes inherent to multiverse stories, but it's so well and unique executed that it definitely joins Spiderverse and EEAAO on the short list of great multiverse stories.

Coherence is a very low budget film. I love the way in which its budget constraints informed it's script and idea. Ultimately the whole film takes place in one house, its yard, or the street outside. This is ingenious because besides being cheap, it also reduces complexity where it doesn't matter which allows for increased complexity of the multiverse premise.

It's also a uniquely directed film. There apparently was no exact script but rather a generic outline of events and descriptions of characters. A few key things were set in stone but most of the specific dialogue was improvised. On top of that, actors were directed to talk over each other in the way that you would naturally if you were hanging out with friends. This leads the whole movie to feel like a home movie in some ways. It grounds the film and it also forces you to focus less on the specifics being said and more on the general reactions of different characters. From this you get a really good sense of the individuals in the group and their complex relationships without needing much exposition. This choice is probably controversial and not for everyone, but I thought it fit really well into the concept!

Like any good mystery story, Coherence drops hints and easter eggs for a clever viewer (or more likely a second-time viewer) to enjoy. Without spoiling too much, there are some obvious times when they point out differences in the multiverses, but even more often there are background nods and hints as to which world we're in or which world a certain character is from. Because of this, the re-watch-ability is high!

And lastly let's discuss themes. If I had to choose one theme for Coherence, it's jealousy. Many of the characters are dissatisfied in life, and when presented with parallel universes this makes them react in strange ways. What I love most about the story is that the multiverses only start branching from the start of the movie (they were decoherent before), so everything we see any version of a character do they were essentially capable of even from the start. This captures very well the ideas that we contain multitudes and that we're capable of both great good and great evil.

The one downside to this movie is the end. It's perhaps cliche for the premise, but more than that it comes a little bit out of nowhere. It has a lot to do with the themes I just mentioned above, but it's not built up enough to feel very realistic.

Overall though I think this is a pretty good film with extra points for being unique, creative, and clever!
