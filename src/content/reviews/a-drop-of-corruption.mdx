A Drop of Corruption is a great continuation of [The Tainted Cup](the-tainted-cup). It has the Din/Ana dynamic that was the heart of the first book, and it continues to have a very interesting mystery with great Sherlock Holmes-like reveals along the way. What this novel adds that the first did not have is a greater development of the world building. I expected that out of a book two, but I was glad to see that it was done quite well too!

I did have one gripe with the book, and that's that it pays some lip service to the idea that slavery is bad and we should stop it. But then at the end when everything really happens (no spoilers), it kind of entirely skips over a ton of human suffering and the drastic consequences of the events of the novel. I'm not sure how I would have preferred it addressed, but by calling such attention to it and then just ignoring it, Bennett makes it worse than it otherwise would have been.

Overall I really enjoyed this book. If you liked the first you will definitely like this one too. It's a very entertaining read with just enough deeper thought in it under the surface as well.
