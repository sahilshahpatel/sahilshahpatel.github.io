I heard a lot about this movie before giving it a go. Many things I heard were contradictory or confusing. So let me start by acknowledging that its hard to describe this movie, and then let me attempt it anyways.

Sinners is a part of a new movement I'm calling "horror as analogy", a movement popularized by Jordan Peele. So it is a horror movie, but it's purpose isn't to scare you non-stop like a haunted house. There are moment of quiet reflection, of tension, and of drama. And those moments build up the scaffolding that allows you to understand what exactly the horror is an analogy for.

In my view, Sinners is about how throughout history Black success has been spotted and specifically torn down before being taken and modified for the profit of white people. In a way, Black people have been fighting vampirism of their success for a very long time. To be clear, this has happened to many oppressed groups over time, and the movie even mentions others. But the focus, of course, is on Black history and the Jim Crow era in particular.

# What I Loved
There is so much to love about sinners. The acting is amazing throughout, and the soundtrack is so heartfelt. Then there are specific moments and choices worth calling out.

## Juke Joint Opening
This one scene -- where Sam plays the blues and summons spirits past and present -- is perhaps the most creative premise for a movie I've heard in a long time. The scene is so well done, from the choreography to the music, to the overwhelming atmosphere.

## Annie's Introduction
The vibe of this movie is fairly obvious early on. It's fairly serious and dark. The one exception to that is Smoke and Stack's introduction. They are so over-the-top that they have a vibe of their own. So the scene where Smoke visits Annie and the grave of their daughter is so necessary. It set the tone really well and gave the audience a necessary look at another side of the twins

## The Chinese Family
There did not have to be a Chinese family in this story. But their addition was very important, highlighting the similarities and differences in different minorities' struggles during this era, and how they related to each other. I honestly hadn't considered this relationship much, and I'm really glad the movie included it

## Religion
After the opening, I thought religion might have a role to play in the story. But then it disappeared for a while. With the full circle ending, I _love_ what they did and said with religion. Nowadays we are often quick to criticize and fight against parts of our culture we feel were forced upon us by our oppressors. Religion, though, stands apart as a uniquely normalized part of that history. South America contains innumerable Catholics, for example, and talking about that can be hard, because it is true that the religion was forced upon their ancestors, but it's also true that many are believers today.

Remmick alluding to the forced adoption of Christianity by the Irish was a perfect and subtle way to give commentary on this topic. Christianity is a huge cornerstone of Black culture (at least it appears to be so to me as an outsider), and yet it is also another remnant of slavery. I feel the movie did not have to address this, but I'm so glad it did.

# Conclusion
Honestly I can't think of much this movie could have done better. It was excellent in its presentation, in its craft, in its ideas, and in its execution. Horror is not my genre, and there were many times while watching this movie that I couldn't look. But this kind of horror is the kind I can get behind. It has meaning and purpose, and I'm more than willing to endure a little fright to absorb the story this movie has to tell.
