_This review was copied from Goodreads_

A book with a very unique and just overall fun premise. The initial story sounds a little silly, and it certainly can be at times. But it is accompanied by a really heartfelt story of a sort of found family.

Even the more typical aspects of the book still manage to have fresh perspective. There are several inter-generational friendships, a romantic relationship which is pretty refreshing (although personally I found it to have a couple of very rare "women writing men" moments), and a look at absentee parents and addiction that had a decent touch of nuance.

Of course, if you're thinking of picking up this book you're probably wanting to know about the octopus! Honestly, I didn't find the octopus that interesting. The conclusion to that storyline is of course great. But I much preferred the chapters of the human characters where the octopus was present compared to the chapters narrated by the octopus. That could be in large part due to the audio book's rendition of his voice and tone, though.

Overall a surprisingly good read that mixed fun and quirky story beats with a very obvious but extremely satisfying narrative journey.

# Addendum
In May 2025, I got to see Shelby Van Pelt in-person at an author event in the Bay Area. When I heard about the event I knew I wanted to go, but I thought it was mostly just because author events are fun. I got there and wasn't sure I cared about getting my book signed. I wasn't a big enough fan, I thought. By the end of the event, though, I had been reminded about everything I loved about this book. While it's still not an A+, it was really good and I'm very happy I have my own signed copy!
