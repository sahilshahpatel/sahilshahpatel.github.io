# Review in Summary
This thriller is wickedly crafted, and deserving of all of the praise it gets. It's honestly quite rare to read the perfect twist ending -- there's a delicate balance between being obvious and being plausible. But The Silent Patient is able to get it just right, playing off of your expectations perfectly to construct a story that will leave you thinking for a while after.

# Full Review
As a mystery thriller, it's hard to talk about this book without giving something away. I honestly think reading the inside flap is all the prior information you'll want. But I will attempt to discuss the book further without spoiling the experience.

Based on the premise, it should be obvious that psychology and therapy play a big role in this story. The brilliance of the plot comes from playing of the reader's pre conceptions about therapy. About the people who get therapy, and about the people who give it.

I don't really know how accurate this book is to the field of psychology. I certainly wouldn't take it as fact. But as fiction, it uses the everyday concepts we are mostly familiar with nowadays to shape our story.

## Spoiler territory
Ok the next and last point is absolutely a spoiler, so don't read on until you've read the book.

I also have a tendency to like stories with unclear timelines. I like that in movies too, like many of Christopher Nolan's, and in books like Wrong Place Wrong Time which is the same genre as The Silent Patient.

I loved the use of the two timelines in this book particularly. There were a lot of things I picked up on early -- Theo stalking the other man, for example, felt like an obvious parallel. But my literature sensibilities told me that such a parallel was an attempt to compare the characters and have them be mutual foils perhaps. It was a way to show Theo's descent into Alicia's state. And in the end that was kind of true, but perhaps backwards, and linked through actual causality rather than just metaphor.

There are so many small things which allow Alex Michaelides to pull this off so well. Theo and Kathy are a bit distant, so he doesn't mention the specifics of his problems at work. Of course you assume that the problems are those from the previous chapter, but there's nothing really linking them. Towards the end you start wondering how he has the energy or could possibly be in the mental state to stalk people after a long day of therapy at the Grove. And that's the part that first gave me pause and started to open that line of thinking, though truthfully the idea was still quite blurry by the time the twist was fully revealed.

One last bit: including Alicia's diary before Theo actually reads it is such a good choice. It makes you wonder where it is, adding to the dramatic tension, and it gives you a point of reference for Alicia who is otherwise inscrutable. But most of all, it sneakily adds distance between you and the narrator, Theo. Unreliable narrator stories are hard to accomplish because readers are naturally inclined to trust the narration. An author must somehow add some separation, and usually this is done by adding some inconsistencies throughout. But Michaelides is even more clever -- he has Theo tell you himself that he is unreliable (cloaked under the assumption of therapeutic humility), and adds extra distance through Alicia's diary, allowing her to become an additional (unreliable) narrator.

Ultimately, that is what will stick with me about this book. The writing and the craft of it all is extremely well done, and should be an inspiration to any future book in the genre.
