I did not know anything going into this book and so I really had no way to expect where it went. The Tainted Cup is a fantasy novel, but really it's a murder mystery that happens to take place in a fantastical world. That's not to say that the fantasy elements aren't good -- in fact the world of this book is one of my favorite things about it -- it's just that it feels more like a typical detective novel more than a typical fantasy one.

This book feels a lot like an episode of BBC's Sherlock. You are given a lot of pieces of the puzzle, but more than solve it yourself you're supposed to just enjoy the moments of revelation along the way. What makes it better than Sherlock is that Din (the Watson-like one) is the main character, and as he learns about the politics of the empire so do we. And so beyond the murder mystery there is the other mystery of "what is this world and what's going on?"

My two big takeaways by the end were first that the pacing at the beginning could have been a little better. It feels slow for sure, though the characters and world made up for that in my experience. And second that the ending theme of "diversity is our strength" was pretty interesting. It isn't hammered home by the climax of the plot necessarily, and you don't feel that message super strongly throughout, but looking back afterwards there are clearly signs of that theme throughout that just aren't accentuated super strongly. I don't know if I've ever seen another book do a theme this way. And just to be clear -- I liked it! While it's not as cathartic as I like themes to be, it doesn't feel preachy or cliche or ham-fisted. It subtle but it works, and it adds a small extra dimension to the story which is nice.

Din and Ana's dynamic is super fun. It's that and the world that really keep you going I think. Besides that I guess there isn't a ton to say. It was just a really fun read that I kept looking forward to continuing. While it is the beginning of a series of sorts, the book works well as a standalone. But I am interested in continuing the series to learn more about the world and its characters!
