The Mesmerist markets itself as a book about, well, mesmerism. If you read the tagline and the inside flap, you might be misled into thinking that whether or not mesmerism is real is going to be the main plot point and thematic interest of the story. The actual intrigue of the story is much better than that, in my opinion.

Simply put, I think The Mesmerist is like an easier-to-read, less historically hefty version of Devil in the White City. Both stories contrast some sort of progress against human regression. In Devil in the White City the progress is technological, while in The Mesmerist it is social (with a focus on women's social issues). The Mesmerist also has a better crafted narrative and so relies less on the reader's interest in history to carry them through the novel.

I really enjoyed this book! It really didn't go in directions I expected, for a few reasons I think. One is that as mentioned above, it's marketing is a little misleading I think. But another is that it has a few central characters, and the way that they exchanged taking the "lead role" in the story surprised me throughout. Without spoilers, the perspective of the narrators turn out to be extremely interesting towards the end as you learn more about what's really going on.

The narrative and characters are certainly a driving force in this book, but I also think the ideas and themes give you a lot to think about. Faith and May go through experiences that you're certain to have opinions about. The idea of how society should treat sex workers and single mothers is obviously there. But I think most of the philosophical intrigue comes from Abby who is seriously conflicted throughout the story. She has progressive social views for her time, but she also believes in some conservatism, and her religion influences her views too. She has to balance what she wants to do with the Bethany Home with what is realistically sustainable given her resources and the times.

Ultimately, The Mesmerist is a fairly quick read that will keep surprising you. The narrative is gripping, and there's enough to keep you thinking for a while after.
