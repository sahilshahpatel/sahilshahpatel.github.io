# Worse than ACOTAR?
After reading ACOTAR, I wasn't super hooked necessarily, and I didn't read the second book immediately. But the same friends who recommended the first said that the second was actually much better written, and so I kept it on my list. Eventually, I had some time and didn't have a particular book I wanted to read, so I decided to give it a go. And I just don't understand -- how is this better than the first? The only real answer I can think of is that I just don't like pure romance, and this second book was lighter on the fantasy and heavier on the romance. But I don't think that's exactly true. I've liked other romance-adjacent books before, and I think I could really enjoy a pure romance. In the end, I think it was the poor quality of the fantasy and plot that actually made me less invested in the romantic relationships.

# A good twist
The set up for this novel from it's precursor was not terrible. Feyre is in love with Tamlin and has mostly saved the day. But her "new enemy" (Rhysand) now can forcibly take her one week of every month. This is an obvious romantic-plot conflict, and it works with the fantasy plot too. You assume that book two will be about taking down Rhysand and then book three will be about the King of Hybern. The twist early on is that Feyre actually likes Rhysand and we come to realize that he's actually the good guy here. I think a more classical take on the twist would be to have the "enemy" of this novel be Tamlin and again save the King for the last book. Instead we get a mini-confrontation with the King as our finale. All-in-all the setup here and general direction is not so bad. However, there are certain elements which personally ruined this portion of the plot.

# The small things matter
My biggest gripe starts from the very beginning. I didn't always love Tamlin and found him a bit controlling. But this book puts that into overdrive from the start. There is no slow ramp to the realization that Tamlin's love is not very healthy -- it's just shoved in your face. It honestly reminds me of The Last Jedi, where I personally loved some of the twists and ideas there, but the early moment of absolute destruction of trust in Luke's character turns most people away from the story. To me, the same thing happens here with Tamlin.

Similarly, Rhys is pretty much a great guy from the get-go, even though he was quite terrible earlier. I could have used a slower burn on him actually being good. I think the first book actually hurt this one as far as this plot goes, because it had Feyre being attracted to Rhys for pretty much no reason. He's essentially abusive, but she finds him hot anyways. And because of that setup, we can't as easily start with ice in the relationship.

Now let's talk motivations, because this is where it all falls apart. Ask yourself -- why does Rhys do what he does? In his mind, he knows very early on that he has a mating bond with Feyre (I find this hugely problematic, but it will get it's own paragraph later). He's a self-sacrificing sad boy and a closet nice-guy, so he decides to pretty much let everything happen. He helps from the shadows with Amarantha, and so far it basically checks out. Now, explain to me this bargain. Taking her for a week every month? How does that fit Rhys at all? He was committed to the "if you love her let her go" thing, but then to "look evil" he decides he has to do this? But then he doesn't enforce it ever, because he's actually nice. But if he never enforces it, wouldn't that be giving away the game?

Fast forward and we learn that Rhys has always been a good guy, but he has to keep up appearances to keep his people safe. This whole arrangement makes no sense to me. His father ruled from the Court of Nightmares, but he wants to make a change. Enough of the faeries agree that he is able to make it happen, but not enough to fully change his society. Instead he splinters it. But the Court of Nightmares must be resentful about this, and yet they never really compromise him to Amarantha or others. The balance is basically maintained soley by the fact that Rhysand is "the most powerful high lord in history" (which I also hate), and yet when he was trapped with Amarantha for 50 years, no one from the court of nightmares tried to do anything about it.

What I'm trying to say really is that Rhysand's whole bit is that he has to be a bad person publicly, but it's for the most wholesome of reasons. And I just don't buy it, not at all. I don't see why he has to behave this way. And as the book goes on, he is suddenly not behaving that way, even in some public circumstances. In fact, his most performative scene is the one in his own territory at the Court of Nightmares -- those people should know that he isn't that way! Didn't he specifically fight with them about his vision for his society??

And as a quick aside, Tamlin's actions also make no sense in this book. Not only does he hard pivot abusive at the beginning out of left field, but then he spends the next 80% of the book MIA, even though we have established that he would go to war over the slightest things. Lucian shows up just to remind you they exist, and then disappears until the very end for the final reveal. That really just didn't make sense to me, whether you think of Tamlin as good or evil, both versions would not have been so inactive.

# Magical mumbo-jumbo
A popular men's conception of romantic novels is that they are basically just erotica. I don't think that's entirely true, and my personal opinion is that the best of romance is about the build up of feelings and the sort of mute-cute of putting characters in interesting situations that end up developing or revealing their feelings for each other. Fantasy is actually great for that because putting characters in unknown and magical situations is ripe for growing connection.

But crucially, fantasy also gives you a lot of freedom to force your characters into situations in unrealistic or illogical ways. As an author you have to be careful that you don't completely abandon the logic of the plot, otherwise the core of the story will fall apart, and it will start to read like fan fiction. And this is where Sarah J. Mass really messes us, in my opinion.

## Mating bonds
Please someone, explain to me what a mating bond is and how it works. Is it just a think faeries have? Does it exists for humans too but they can't sense it? Can it be broken or not? These kinds of questions have conflicting answers throughout the story.

Rhysand knew about his mating bond with Feyre since before she was a faerie. That means that it can happen between faeries and humans, right? And yet Lucian feeling a mating bond with Elaine specifically after she becomes a faerie suggests the opposite. Really, I think Mass just wanted a soul mates or destined lovers thing, and so she decided Rhysand had known all along.

Are men (or "males" as she says -- which, oh god that gives me the ick) the only ones who can feel a mating bond when it first starts? If so, why? If a woman can reject the bond, then what does that mean? This is actually quite important, because Rhys knowing about it early on and Feyre not knowing but ultimately making the choice to accept it were crucial parts of the plot. And the plot twist of Lucian bonding with Elaine also depends on some of these questions.

## "Power"
I really dislike ACOTAR's description of power. I know this is a classic fantasy nerd critique, but good magic systems have some logic! I don't think every system has to be 100% explained and understandable, but ACOTAR essentially devolves into an ["I'm pointing my wand as hard as I can!"](https://youtu.be/YsYWT5Q_R_w?si=u6BU0AJJf8dreL4S&t=99) system, where the actual strength and capabilities of characters are entirely determined by what would be convenient for them to be able to do or not be able to do.

Feyre learning to manage her powers could have been a really cool story of empowerment for someone who felt powerless in her life. Her abusive ex was trying to convince her that she was fragile, and she then learns about her own inner strength. Except no, no she doesn't. She randomly is able to make water dogs at some point and otherwise her powers are basically uncontrolled explosions until the very end where she crafts the most insanely intricate magic of all time and somehow nobody notices. Where is the progression? Where is the character development associated with these plot points?

And what exactly does "power" get you? The King of Hybern seems to think he can break a mating bond. But the other characters seem to understand that this is impossible. So why would he think that? Does he himself not know the limitations of his magic system? Is it just hubris? It really makes no sense if you consider it -- it's just hidden behind the fact that the reader themselves doesn't understand the magic system, so we might forget that the in-world characters should.

# Conclusion
Did I hate this book? No. It was entertaining, actually. I am a bit of a sucker for redemptions arcs, and so I liked Rhys being a good guy, and I enjoyed most the backstories of the Court of Dreams possy. But I was told that this second book was going to be better written than the first, and I think that expectation spoiled it a bit. The first book started with its fish-out-of-water story of Feyre learning about Prythian to carry it through some of the weaker plot logic early on. But this book doesn't have much of the same. Feyre's exploration is mostly in Velaris, but the description of the city feels like pretty much any cool city in real life, and so the exploration is not nearly as interesting to me as it is to her. And unfortunately, her character isn't enough for me to empathize with her and appreciate that moment for what it means to her.

The romance is alright. I think it was forced and convenient at times. And the will-they-won't-they ping pong got a little out of hand towards the end. The action scenes were so much worse than the ones in the first book too, and the action plot culminated in a super underwhelming climax where none of my questions were really answered. (Is Durian really an important character here? It feels like she just wanted some epic call back, but him siding with the King doesn't make too much sense, and he's just a random human warrior so what do I care? Is resurrecting him really a huge problem for our main characters?)

Ultimately, I considered giving this book a B-, just like ACOTAR. But it was just worse. There were fewer redeeming qualities. I found myself even more dissapointed by the finale than I was in ACOTAR, and I liked the beginning and middle less too. So it just didn't feel fair to rate them the same. As such, A Court of Mist and Fury ends up in C tier, with very little company (at least currently).
