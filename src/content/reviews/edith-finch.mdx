*What Remains of Edith Finch* is truly an experience. It's a walking simulator (a term I generally dislike but is pretty appropriate here), but with its tone, intriguing narrative, and creative visual style, the gameplay actually feels refreshingly unique. As a fan of stories, I found myself sucked in to the world of the Finches and their family history. And as a programming nerd, there were a lot of gameplay moments I marveled at (interactive comic book, the cannery, and the sea monster, just to name a few).

I definitely did not know what I was getting into playing this game. I was expecting a 2D point-and-click game, perhaps like Florence. While this game had a similar narrative vibe to Florence, the gameplay was also uniquely creative and elevated the experience in my opinion. There are many parts of this game which would work well in a movie, but there are also a few that take such good advantage of the video game medium, even in a very light-on-gameplay, story-based game. In particular the cannery scene makes you actively empathize with Lewis as you hear his story -- I personally was robotically decapitating fish with one hand while exploring Lewistopia with the other, even when the game didn't require it. The sea monster scene with Molly was also particularly good. It's harder to describe exactly why, but there is an added creepiness to Molly's story when you as the player also become these animals and eventually the monster. Especially because Molly's story is the first that you experience, I think it sets the tone so well, and I think that is accentuated by the gameplay of that scene.

This game is definitely in A tier. It's a quick play and easy to "learn", but shows clearly the dedication the team had to both story and gameplay. I have to be honest, though, that the ending was not enough to push it to A+ or S tier. While it was an interesting ending and at least decent, I think the buildup to something grand makes the actual ending feel a little lack-luster. The final thought is quite a nice one, but it feels a little cliche and doesn't hit hard enough to excuse that.
