Note: This review is based on the rendition performed in D.C. at the National Theater. This version was cut down to a single 3 hour show from the original two-day 5 hour show.

I read the script for The Cursed Child when it first came out and I don't remember being much of a fan. By the time I saw the actual play though, I'd forgotten most of the details. All I really remembered was that it was about Albus Severus Potter, and that I didn't like it. Shortly before watching it, I was told that the reason it's a great show is not for its story but for its performance.

And boy was that right! The magic in the show is just stellar. They did great prop work which made it feel like trunks were floating by magic and pulling the actors along. They had pyrotechnics on large and small scales to accentuate the magic. They used slight of hand throughout to really add to the feel of magic being constantly in use. They used wires extremely well such that you never saw a harness or a string, and most of the time objects were clearly being held without a wire and then attached to one without your noticing.

But there were two effects which require extra praise. First, the stage lighting was amazing. They managed to make a big rectangle in the front of the stage brightly lit, but just behind it was completely pitch black. This allowed people wearing black cloaks to walk behind the main actors completely unseen and assist in effects. This is how they did polyjuice potion, transfiguration, and more, all of which were so cool!

The second is also a lighting trick but even more impressive. The characters use time turners throughout the story, and each time there is this effect that seems like it should only be possible with digital effects. They basically caused the whole stage to warble with a gravitational wave-like effect. My best guess for how they managed it is by mapping out the set and background for each of those moments and then projecting out an image specifically calculated to light that background such that it looked like it warbled. However they did it, it was absolutely stunning and all I could think about during the entire show! If you're a theater nerd or a lighting nerd, it's worth going to see this show just for that alone.

Let's also quickly address the story. I'll be honest -- it's still not great. I do feel, though, that a lot of its shortcomings are more forgivable in play from than in book form. The montages and fast pace, the big dramatic character moments that aren't necessarily built up with deep emotional ground work. These things just felt a lot less offensive as I watched them on stage as compared to my memory of reading them in a book.

Afterwards, we discussed whether it was a mistake to have released the script as a book and have it marketed so heavily that way, especially when the show was quite inaccessible until now (only in New York and London, apparently). They certainly made more money this way, but I also think the story will be remembered a lot less and thought of in lower regard because of it, and that's kind of sad.

Personal thoughts on J.K. Rowling aside, this show is a lot of fun. It's interesting on a technical level, it's got great hits of nostalgia, and it does get emotional too at a few points. Besides the idea of supporting the author and besides its high ticket price, this is a show worth seeing.
