# My Expectations
I really knew nothing about Watership Down before reading it. When it was suggested for book club, I recognized the name slightly, but I just knew it was a sort of classic. I actually thought it was a war novel about some naval crew. When I found out it was "about rabbits" I got pretty curious and even more excited to give it a read. But I really knew nothing substantial going in.

As I started reading, I expected a story like Animal Farm -- an allegory by animals that was really about human problems. But Watership Down isn't quite that. It's animals are far more, well, animal. Their struggles are relatable at times, but they face real limitations based on their animal forms. They don't have our intelligence, our knowledge of the world, or our curiosity. But that's what really made this book special to me.

# The Unique Voice
What really makes Watership Down special is its unique voice. The story is told in a very folk-story form, on multiple levels. The most obvious are the actual in-world rabbit folk stories that are told throughout the book in their own chapters. These stories are honestly the best chapters of the book -- they are entertaining in their own right and they also deepen the culture of the rabbits in a very meaningful way.

The second folk-story element is the plot style. The adventure happens in clear and separate "acts". While they are all related and form a larger cohesive story, they also work well separately, just as the stories of El-ahrairah do. The acts themselves are also much more similar to historical epics than most modern novels. Plot conveniences happen all the time. Foreshadowing is heavy handed. Characters often change rapidly to meet the needs of the moment rather than going through subtle character arcs. These things may sound like complaints, but they actually work very well together to tell a type of story that stands out from other more modern options.

# My Overall Thoughts
I don't feel the need to go into a great deal of detail with this story. There isn't a lot of micro storytelling beats or writing choices that I want to dissect. But I _really_ liked this novel. It is a fun adventure story on its own, but it also touches on interesting themes, particularly about leadership and society. While the book can be brutal at times, I totally understand why many people read this book to their children. It's approachable and easy to read in pieces, but has that hidden depth that the best of children's storytelling often has. Though in truth, I would not label this a "children's novel" at all -- it works equally well for both adults and children for different reasons.

Watership Down is an easy A+ for me. It's a super solid novel, was entertaining the whole way through, had great themes, and was also quite unique. It almost deserves its own S-type category -- while it wasn't world-changing for me (like most of the rest of S-tier), it did get added onto a short list of books I would like to read to my theoretical children, and that's not an easy feat.
