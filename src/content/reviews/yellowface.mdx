# Review in Summary
Yellowface is certainly a provocative book, handling issues of race and identity politics in a really unique, often comedic style. You will hate every character in the novel, but doing so will allow you to stay unbiased as you consider each characters actions and intentions.

# Review in Full
When I was recommended this book, I read the synopsis and thought I knew what it would be like. Not necessarily in a bad way, but I assumed it would take a pretty far-off 3rd person perspective to allow space for an academic breakdown of the dynamics of the story.

R. F. Kuang probably also knew that that would be the traditional take on this story, and so she went in the complete opposite direction. The story is told in the first person, by our somewhat unreliable narrator June. I say somewhat because June is honest with herself sometimes and entirely dishonest other times. She is prone to convincing herself she is a good person and hasn't done anything egregious, just like most human beings.

## The beginning
The inciting incident of the story is June stealing her friend's unfinished manuscript on the same night that she dies in her arms. Which is quite egregious, of course, but Kuang handles this well by making it so that June never explicitly describes this action, because she herself knows how cold-hearted it seems.

## The middle
The middle of this book is fairly predictable, I think. June's story is certainly interesting, but the racial commentary and the online vitriol is a story we've all heard at this point.

The story is shaken up a bit when it moves on to June's second book, which I didn't exactly expect, but its largely more of the same.

Which is not to say that this section is bad. It's actually quite entertaining and funny at times. The scene where June goes to the Asian American Society's meeting and has an awkward misunderstanding with the organizer is so well done. You kind of hate June, but also the organizer probably should have done more research.

And here I'll also note the small things that Kuang does well. June has so many small moments of "microaggressions" if you will. She hates Chinese food, comments on "Asian women being short", and other small things. These moments really add to the impression that June isn't necessarily overtly racist, but she definitely has those implicit biases that we all do, and the way that contributes to our value judgments around her decisions adds to the nuance of the story.

## The ending
(Spoiler territory)

I was planning on labeling this as a B+ until the ending. And even the ending was a rollercoaster of its own. June's descent into madness was a little rushed to me, and suddenly giving credence to the supernatural felt over the top. When she confronts Candice the writing is so cinematic and felt so disjointed from the rest of the book that I also didn't like it at first.

But once I got to the very end I understood why Kuang wrote it this way. The cinematic writing and kind of crazy plot is all a commentary on the dramatacism of rhetoric around this topic. The end itself is both characters taking the drama into their own hands, attempting to control the narrative, and nobody really loses -- both seem to win in the end with absolutely no justice or resolution for the initial conflict. And that's the point.

## Thematic thoughts
Discussing the themes of this book is a little dangerous. Feelings around these issues are complex and emotional. So I won't go into everything in extreme depth in a public review online. But I will say that this book did speak to some feelings which I have had, but which are complicated to express and often paired with some shame.

Ultimately, after having read this book, I've decided to call that feeling "racial angst". And really, I think racism in this book is intended as a stand-in for other identity politics included gender and class, so "identity angst" might be the more universal concept. I think we can all agree that racism is bad, and we want to get rid of it. We know what the world used to be like, and we know what we want it to be like. But the actual process of getting to a bias-free world is incredibly hard and complicated. On the societal scale, publishers lauding their diverse writers is probably a good thing -- it increases visibility for identities which are otherwise under-represented, which is necessary to move our culture towards one free of bias. At the same time, those equity-focused initiatives can feel bad on the individual scale. Candice feels shut out by the industry while Athena, from upon the "diversity pedestal" (ostensibly) feels pigeon-holed into writing "Asian" stories. June feels that her perspective is no longer valuable and starts to get bitter.

Is everyone equally at fault here? Is everyone's pain worth the same amount? Honestly, I think that question is flawed -- there are some things which can't be compared and human pain is one of them. Everyone will have to go through some pain in this transition of culture, and certainly June and Candice are not examples of how to handle this pain well. But the fact that they exist, and the fact that real people like them also exist is evidence that perhaps our transition isn't going super smoothly, and perhaps it's worth considering why.

## The irony of Yellowface
Finally, I'd be remiss if I did not mention the ultimate irony of this book. June is not the right person to tell the stories of the Chinese diaspora, so she is told. And here is R. F. Kuang telling the story of the frustrated white woman. Why is she allowed to do this? Does it matter that she's not white? Does being a woman herself make it slightly better? It's all complicated, just like with June but without the plagiarism.

What I will say is that writing this story (which is quite obviously an Asian American story too, by the way) from a white woman's perspective is actually so genius. Not only does it add a layer of irony, but it also helps balance the narrative. Because it is so easy to hate June -- and you do hate her -- but you hate her a little less because she is the protagonist. Kuang can comment negatively on her own experience of racial angst through June, but by making her unreliable and hatable, she can also comment on racism and the forms it takes. For me, the perspective through which this story is told is the thing that makes it unique, what enables it to reflect in such a nuanced way on our attempts to eradicate racism without feeling like a repeat of every other story about racism from the last decade.
