I read Parable of the Sower at a uniquely poignant time, completely by chance. The book is set starting in 2024 and through 2027, and I read it in 2025. The book features dramatic fires in California and we were just experiencing the terrible fires in LA. The book shows incredible disillusionment with politics and Donald Trump had just been reelected to the presidency. So while Parable of the Sower will always give you a lot to talk about, it was particularly interesting to me because of the moment that I read it in.

The easiest comparison for this book is that it is in the genre of, say, The Giver or Farenheit 451, but instead of relying on a very foreign dystopic concept, Parable of the Sower feels like it is a real near-future possibility for our world. What really makes it unique is that it is not a story of a society at its height, nor is it a story of the absence of society. Instead it is a story of the inbetween -- a society in the process of crumbling, and in the process of being picked up again before its all lost. In that vein, the decision making of the characters is extra hard to criticize, because holding on to the past feels somewhat reasonable, but so does giving in to the despair of the future. The ideas of the novel are very interesting and the situation is quite unique, easily putting it in A tier. However, I did give it an A-, and I have reasons for doing so.

Parable of the Sower is told in a journal format. This isn't necessarily a negative, but between that and the detatched personality of the main character Lauren, the action and emotions of the scenes are a lot less hard-hitting than they could be. I do believe this was a deliberate choice, but I don't think anything particularly interesting was done with it that would warrant the downsides. Especially in the beginning of the book before they leave the enclave, I felt that the journal format really hindered my ability to connect with the characters and the story.

Additionally, the end dissapointed me. There are a lot of interesting ideas in the book that go unfinished. Lauren's hyperempathy is interesting but ultimately I felt it went nowhere (her regular emotional empathy was way more impactful than her medical condition). Her feeling that she needed to dress as a man never really went anywhere. Harry's original attitude of wanting to help everyone, and his later realization that they couldn't never went anywhere (and it didn't interact in interesting ways with Lauren's changing perspective). Lauren is constantly worried about being betrayed but it literally never happens (she is attacked, but never betrayed). I know this is a series, and I was a little forgiving of all this initially with the thought that the later books would explore these topics more. However, I learned that the second book focuses on Lauren's daughter, and I think that kind of time skip will inherently leave this loose strings loose.

Overall I quite liked this book and could easily recommend it. But I do have to dock it points because while it had quite interesting ideas and a very unique setup, I don't think it made good on the potential that it had.
