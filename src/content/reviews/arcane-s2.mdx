While Arcane Season One was a clear S+ tier for me, season two doesn't make it as far. The story is still entertaining, but it has some pacing issues. Additionally, the scope of the story increases so much as to lose what made it really special in season one.

The first three episodes of the season are paced too fast for my taste. In particular, I think they tried to make too complex of character arcs for a single three-episode act. In season one act one, Powder and Vi go through two point arcs, starting at one point and ending at another. In season two, however, Vi goes through three-point arc. First she doesn't want to be an enforcer, then is an enforcer, then leaves the enforcers/Caitlyn. Because she has to go through two changes, the build up to each felt rushed to me.

Vi is given the most focus, and other characters are fast forwarded. Viktor's transformation is so out of the blue it's distracting. And I was so excited for Heimer and Ekko, but most of their time is skipped over and they're quickly back in Piltover.

The next act was better. It returned to the more personal story between Vi and Jinx that I was craving. In particular, the scene where they find Vander's letter to Silco was really good. And most of all, Jinx's arc with Isha is just so perfect. Jinx learns what it is to be Vi and want to take care of someone. She gains fulfillment and purpose through Isha. And the final scene is so gripping and perfect and heart shattering. That's the Arcane I came to watch.

Cait in act two remained disappointing. I don't mind her sort of knowing Ambessa was using her the whole time, but I do mind that we got zero indication of this and her turn is so sudden that the actual character moment of it is lost in favor of a plot moment.

Act two also conspicuously lacked Ekko, a character I really wanted to see. All of this was forgiven though when I watched episode seven. That episode is definitely my favorite episode out of all of season two. It sits in that bittersweet emotion and the small, personal scope that I think the writers are so good at.

The last two episodes were good too, but felt more plot heavy than character heavy. Really only Jinx and Ekko continued to get the deep character moments I was wanting.

To address Viktor and Jayce a bit, I am a little mixed on their story. I think the scope of Viktor got out of hand really fast. In a different show just about them, I would have wanted more time to see Viktor understand Jayce's point. In this show with everything it has to balance, I'd say they did a pretty good job of it actually.

As for Mel and Ambessa, I found Maddie's betrayal a little pointless, but Mel's play of the Black Rose and Ambessa against each other was interesting and perfect for her politicing personality. The Black Rose sub plot was very vague, but I don't mind that as it was never meant to be the focus and is a clear target for a spinoff.

In general season two was entertaining and I certainly enjoyed it. But the giant scope of the plot lead it to overshadow character moments and force a too-fast pace. The emotional core of the story is still there, but not nearly as strongly as it was in season one.
