Since the original Knives Out makes S tier for me, I'm always going to give a new Knives Out mystery a chance. Glass Onion did not meet my expectations, but I'm so happy that Wake Up Dead Man did! Rian Johnson is clearly experimenting with this series. The first was more mystery focused and the social commentary was more in the background. The second continued to lean into the mystery, increased the comedy, and had a lot of social commentary (though not very well executed in my opinion). The third actually backs off of the mystery and comedy a little in order to focus on executing the social commentary perfectly.

Let's start with the background elements. The movie sets up an obvious answer to the initial question of what's going to happen. While the final conclusion isn't as obvious, the fact that it happens in two stages and that the first stage is telegraphed removes focus from the mystery. And while the topic is a serious one, the exposition section in particular is really funny. Compared to Glass Onion, the rest of the movie has less comedy, but I really liked the balance.

But the real best part of this movie is how it talks about its central idea. I really love how the ads I saw for this movie did not reveal that (slight spoiler) it's all commentary on religion. The story is really thoughtfully crafted to discuss whether religion is fueled by fear or love, and it gets even more multidimensional as the movie goes on. This movie captured a lot of what I think about religion so perfectly that I can't help but love it!

One extra thing I found so interesting about this movie is that it can be used as a litmus test that I've always wanted to do. If you're religious and you can only see the criticisms this movie has to offer, then you've failed the test. Passing would be to be able to process the criticisms but also notice the praise it gives. I think that so many of us shut down when we receive any criticism which prevents us from being receptive to nuanced takes which might combine criticism and praise. I don't know what topic would do this for me or if I would pass the test, but I could only hope so, and I think it's awesome that this movie can capture the essence of that dilemma.
