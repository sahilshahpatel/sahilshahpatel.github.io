This book was not what I expected. On its face, the premise is "what if women turned into dragons naturally sometimes". This lead me to believe that it was going to explore female empowerment through dragoning. In short, I thought this story would be an alternate future. Instead, it is a reframing of our actual past.

In our book club discussion for this novel, a lot of people complained that it didn't feel all that empowering, or that the characters didn't exercise their agency enough. The biggest criticism was that the dragons, being such powerful beasts, don't make convincing victims of oppression (why didn't they just take what they wanted by force?). I think that this largely misses the point of the novel. Dragoning is a metaphor, and you're really not supposed to consider the logical consequences of its reality.

The strength of this book is not in its world-building per se, but instead in its characterization. Alex and her mom are endlessly fascinating to me. I have yet to read a novel that so accurate captures the cognitive dissonance of desiring freedom but being trapped by shame. We live in a world where women also often oppress other women, and this book captures that very well (in addition to having its host of oppressive men, of course).

I have a few criticisms as well, though. First, I thought this book dragged a bit in the middle. It was originally a short story and I think you can tell. Additionally, while for most of the story you aren't supposed to consider logical consequences of dragoning, the end is based fully upon that, and that felt odd to me.

The main criticism though is that the metaphor of dragoning is too expansive. This too is a symptom of its origin as a short story. Dragoning was originally just a metaphor for female rage, so say the acknowledgements. But over time the author clearly wanted to address more facets of feminism in her book. However, this ends up confusing a few important notions. Is dragoning a woman escaping the bounds of oppression? If so, we would be rooting for all our characters to dragon. But the end tells us that every woman is different -- some don't want to dragon and that's ok. But the beginning only shows us examples of women not dragoning when the burdens of society force them into hard choices. \[SPOILERS\] If Beatrice can go back and forth, what does that mean for the metaphor? Dragoning clearly isn't just rage, and it isn't just oppression either. It becomes a lot more nebulous because the author attempted to be more inclusive in its definition, but did not rewrite the plot to make full sense with this new definition.

That being said, I don't really think this inconsistency affects the quality of the story that much. Her point is still very clear. And, as I mentioned before, it's her characterizations that are her super power, and those alone made me love this book.

This is absolutely an A+ for me, and would likely be an S tier for others, especially if they read it at the right time in their lives.
