*A Sea of Unspoken Things* is another atmospheric and melodramatic character-driven mystery. It seems like Adrienne Young has found a new genre for herself, and I love it! Unfortunately, this was probably my least favorite of her three such stories so far. I did enjoy James' character and I thought some of the plot decisions were quite unique and well done. Ultimately though the setting didn't have as much charm as [*Spells for Forgetting*](spells-for-forgetting) and the mystery wasn't as well crafted as [*The Unmaking of June Farrow*](june-farrow).

The main thing I found unique about this book was the description of Johnny. I loved how mysterious he felt -- truly an enigma of a person. It felt both like James did understand him and that she did not in the slightest at the same time, and I think that's a hard feeling to capture. I especially loved the section where James is doubting her brother and wondering if he could have done something truly terrible. I think that question of "could someone I love have really done this" is so interesting and not very explored.

This story also reminded me of a friend's critique of June Farrow. Namely that June was a pretty unemotional character. Reading this book I felt more that way than I had in the other two, though I think in reality they are all similar in that way. That's not something that bothers me terribly, perhaps because I relate a lot to the way these characters perceive and react to the world. But I could totally understand how someone else might feel that this makes them uninteresting.

As always, the light romance of Young's novels was perfect. It is an integral part of the story and yet does not consume the rest. And at least to me, the romantic connection her characters have always feels very real. And of course the thing Young is best at is her atmospheric righting. She loves a good small town setting and she's absolutely nailed the vibe she wants to create.

Even though this was my least favorite of the three, I still enjoyed it a lot and was never really bored. I think the ending was not extremely satisfying in the couple hard turns it takes one after another right at the very end, but the main story is really about James and that part did end satisfyingly.
