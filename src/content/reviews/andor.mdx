_This is a review of the first season of Andor. The review of season two is [here](andor-s2)._

_This review was written after re-watching the show in preparation for season two._

Andor is hands down the best piece of Star Wars media made to date. In an era of sequels and remakes, it is especially refreshing that this show is standalone. It requires to other knowledge of anything Star Wars to be appreciated. It is grounded, and it has interesting ideas that are expressed through characters who you actually care about. I love that it is Star Wars not because it is made better by its peers but because it makes its peers better, and I can finally say there exists Star Wars media that lives up to the promise of that universe and the stories it has to tell.

# What I Liked
From the get-go, Andor sets a tone I quite like. It's clearly a serious story, and it doesn't waste too much time being funny. Intercutting between Andor on Ferrix and Andor on Kenari is great in my opinion. While his Kenari roots don't ultimately mean much more than the inciting incident they create, they do add intrigue to the character, and add some suspense to the early episodes that the main storyline would not have.

And let's talk about Syril. Syril is just such a good character. A story about rebellion against oppression is great, but it's also obvious. A story about the banality of evil is more interesting but it's been done. But weaving the story of someone growing towards rebellion (Andor) and the story of someone who was been indoctrinated to only find purpose in control (Syril) is just so good. He gives us a crucial reminder that not only are the every day people of Ferrix human, but so are the every day people of the Empire. It is a reminder to stand up against what is clearly wrong, but also a warning that evil isn't always foreign -- it's often of our own making.

Andor has an interesting story structure over the course of its first season. We have Kenari (backstory), Ferrix pre-Aldhani, Aldhani (heist), Narkina 5 (prison), and Ferrix post-Aldhani. These separate sequences don't fit well into the basic three act structure that you might want for say a movie. But they can work well in a 12 episode TV season that has time to explore each one, and can tie back in the themes and plot of each by the end. This unique structure makes Andor feel less predictable than other more formulaic shows.

# What's Next
I don't know what exactly is next for Andor. I'm afraid because season two is supposed to cover all the ground in between season one and the beginning of Rogue One. While I like Rogue One a lot, any time you are forced to connect one story to another there can be complications and compromises made. Part of what I loved about Andor originally was that it was completely standalone, even from Rogue One. I really hope they can do a good job of keeping true to the original story's tone and gravity while also connecting it to the larger stakes of Rogue One.
