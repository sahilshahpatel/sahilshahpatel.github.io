# Review in Summary
I didn't have high expectations for Cassette Beasts going in. While I enjoyed Pokemon as a kid, I fell off that train even faster than most of my friends, and revisiting the games I am always reminded that I don't really like the progression of those game, I don't like the grind, and I don't like the strategy either. Knowing that Cassette Beasts is in the same genre, I thought it would have all the same annoyances. But I was so wrong! Cassette Beasts solves every one of those problems and I was absolutely gripped by the game. I do have some complaints, but nothing that ruined my experience with the game.

# Full Thoughts

## Improvements on the genre
Cassette Beasts differentiates itself from Pokemon pretty well (Note: I've heard that this game is also similar to Persona, but I haven't played that nor do I know anything about it, so I won't make comparisons to it here). Let me list a few of the main differences, and then I'll dive into the ones I liked and why:
- All double battles
- Type advantages are status effects (not bonus damage)
- Moves require a certain amount of AP (think energy or mana) which builds over time
- You can fuse two beasts into one
- Exploration is more open with fewer obvious roads/paths
- Move lists can be very long and can be easily changed
- HMs are unlocked by capturing a certain beast, and it doesn't need to be in your party to use the effect
- Stat bonuses don't stack but increase in duration when repeated
- Shinies are type-bent, not just cool looking
- Status effects and AP are linked to the player, not the beast

### Battles
Ok let's start with the big three that changed battle mechanics: team size, type advantage, and AP. All three of these are great changes to the formula, in my opinion.

Double battles are just more interesting, especially in how they make you think about targeting. They also add the possibility of "team-wide" moves and the "multi-target" status effect, both of which were fun to play around. There is also the added strategy of picking two beasts whose movesets complement each other, and lastly it's just fun to see more of your beasts out at once.

The changes to type advantage are great too. The chart can be a bit confusing to read, and the "logic" behind each type advantage effect can be hard to remember, but the end result of type advantages as status effects is just endlessly more interesting than increased/decreased damage. It wasn't impossible to play into a type disadvantage, but it felt great to combo things off of a type advantage status effect, or there were times when a debuff would ruin your game plan and you would have to remake your team for the situation.

AP is great because it gives players a reason to invest in status effects or otherwise use abilities which aren't straight nukes. You can have one beast that has mostly low AP moves that set up another beast that has high AP moves. You can save up AP on one beast and switch to another that has a high AP nuke. There's lots of options here which add depth and planning to the decision of which move to use.

The last big battle change is fusion, which I won't discuss here because I actually didn't love that mechanic. But more on that later...

Before moving on, I want to mention quickly a couple of the battle moments that really made my fall in love with the system. First was my battle with the plastic archangel (I don't remember the name). This was soon after I had remixed Felix's starter into Fungogh, and I was thinking that his type-switching kit was pretty awkward and useless. Little did I know, deciding to use him was the key to my victory! Changing his type made my main beast Galagor's weakness to plastic less annoying, and it also allowed me to get type advantaged attacks on the otherwise typeless archangels. This battle solidified my team and main strategy for the rest of the game and I really didn't waver much.

Second was the fight with Ianthe, which was the first (non-archangel) battle that was actually difficult. It got me to think about my stickers and passive effects more than I ever had. Next was the fight with Aleph which I won't give spoilers for but that battle was cool for aesthetic/emotional reasons more than strategic ones but I loved it. And lastly, for the final Morgante fight I discovered a little cheesy leech strategy where I could have infinite walls and heal back with leech while also doing more damage per turn that way, even after having been knocked down to a single fighter. That strategy wouldn't be fun long term, but it was pretty cool to discover it in the moment and use it to win what looked like a lost battle!

### Exploration
The exploration aspect of Pokemon games, for example, always felt a little lack-luster. It was mostly linear and it was more about getting far along the straight path (and being able to defeat the trainers along the way) than it was about finding your own path. (It's possible the new 3D games are different, but that's not too relevant). Cassette Beasts, on the other hand, uses basically an open-world design. It's a bit like a metroidvania where unlocking certain moves (think HMs) eventually unlock new areas (though the moves are a bit janky and I'll get to that later). But even without many of the powers there is a vast area that you could theoretically explore.

Playing through the game I didn't think too much of this. I felt like I was doing things in the "sensible" order, really. Only a few times did my partner chime in to tell me that the area that we were in was likely too high level for me. But when we had our Indie Game Club meeting for this game, I learned that everyone had done a pretty different order. I hadn't met Meridith until almost the end of the game, for example, while others did that quite early on. That was probably because I didn't unlock the other side of town for a long while, and that caused me to do quite a few things later than likely intended. Overall though I think that's great -- the option to explore according to your own curiosity is what makes open world games fun, and Cassette Beasts gave me that without making it feel impossible to find anything interesting in any given tile.

The novelty of exploration made this game way more fun to play. I liked the battles, and it's fun to find a cool beast and try to record it, but a lot of this game is running around to explore the next area or figure out the next puzzle or find the next box. So the fact that exploration is fun makes a big difference in making the basic gameplay loop fun too.

## A little unbalanced
Ok let's move on to some negatives. I don't have much to say for this category, but there are some moves which allow you to ignore type weakness which I thought removed some of the fun of the strategy. There are also a few super overpowered builds (e.g. full "random starter" plus "headshot") that break the game.

## And a little jank
Similarly there are a few pieces which just feel janky or not that well thought out. My team was sort of built around Galagor (because Tardigrades are the bestigrades), and specifically around "Mind Meld". However, this move interacts pretty weirdly with sleep and with auto-cast moves in particular. It's possible this was intended, but it was pretty unintuitive to me as a player. I did end up using it a lot though so I don't hate it in principle, I just think it felt janky.

There are a few other interactions which make sense if you imagine being the programer and writing the logic of the system, but intuitively feel quite bad. The game only allows you to have one partner follow you at a time. When I first switched from Kayleigh to Felix, I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. After a while I wanted to switch to one of my beasts and realized it wasn't in my party. I legitimately thought the game had bugged out and I had lost it since it wasn't in my storage either. In the end, it turned out that Kayleigh was holding it, and when I switched between her and Felix she kept her tape so that I could get Felix's starter. This does make some sense but it's pretty unintuitive that the beast Kayleigh has appears nowhere else and I can't find it unless I switch back again.

The other partner-based interaction in this category is that if your partner dies (i.e. beast gets knocked out and the partner gets knocked out), and you use a respool on their beast, you still can't switch to that beast! It gets locked because the person themselves is down, I guess.

Then we get to the minor annoyances. The game loads its maps in chunks, and it feels like a single chunk is maybe 50-75% of the size of the map. I don't understand why they didn't either make the whole thing a single chunk or split it into smaller chunks and load them in the background. As it is there is a giant stutter when you hit a chunk boundary and it loads the next one. And for me there was a chunk boundary right in the middle of the town! (It seems like the boundaries are dynamic because it wasn't always there, but man that was annoying).

Smaller, but I found it annoying as well that when you go to rearrange your stickers on a beast, you are only given the option to swap sticker locations and no option to shift them around. Especially because there are a significant number of button-presses in between each swap operation in the UI, this made it really inconvenient to rearrange stickers and I ended up just not doing it much and leaving my beasts unorganized.

And finally, the biggest jank of all... physics. Why oh why did they choose to add physics to this game?? Barrels and boxes and metal cubes and all of those things are soooo messed up. You try and walk by them and they freak out. You jump on top and they teleport around. There was a puzzle once where you had to stack some objects and it was an absolute nightmare because they'd just glitch around the whole time. You could also squeeze past a lot of the trainers on the map to get past them (funnily enough you can also just jump over them, and there's an achievement for that, but that feels a lot more intentional and funny). The pumpkin beast's climb ability was also really weird since you could trick it sometimes into not using as much stamina. Overall I just felt that there had to be a better way. The physics is really not used for much, so couldn't it have been removed entirely?

## The big bets
Cassette beasts also took a few big bets on other features of there game that I thought missed, or didn't quite hit.

First, let's discuss Fusion. I... just did not care about Fusion. There are story moments where you are forced to fuse with your partner and every time that happened I was kind of just annoyed and I instantly unfused. I don't hate the concept, but what I loved so much about the battle system was the interaction between beasts and the dynamics of a double battle, so removing that felt pretty bad. I didn't mind when the opponent fused, but I just never wanted to do so myself. Since I mostly ignored Fusion throughout the game, I didn't really think about it much until our Indie Game Club meeting where it was brought up as a "major hook of the game". And really that's probably true. They spent a lot of time to make all the fusions (or make the system that makes them), so I can imagine that it might have been a decent part of the marketing too. Personally that effort felt a little wasted, which is unfortunate.

Second we have the story beats. Pokemon is really not a story-heavy game. The story it does have is all about the enemy "Team" (e.g. Rocket), and is pretty basic really. Cassette Beasts tries to change this with a more character-focused and emotional story. I actually loved this and am generally positive on it, but I do think that it slightly missed the mark. What I really liked was the general vibe embodied by the [lyrics of _Wherever We Are Now_](https://wiki.cassettebeasts.com/wiki/Wherever_We_Are_Now); the idea of making the most of what you're given and the bittersweetness of having lost your life but having made new friends. Each partner character had their own vibe and personal story, and that made it pretty fun to interact with them. Personally I liked Kayleigh and Felix and low-key hated Euguene, and that made the game have more character which was nice. I also liked the fact that Viola existed, though I met her too late to really spend much time with her. And Meredith I didn't care much for either way, and I also met her pretty late.

While I liked the individual characters, some of the story beats felt a little weird. The cult stuff with Kayleigh was taken seriously at times but was so comically underdeveloped that I wasn't sure how to feel about it. The idea behind the archangels and New Wirral as a whole was interesting but also underdeveloped, so it didn't hit that hard. The final scene was not bad, but it was also really short and felt a little anticlimactic. Especially with Kayleigh and Felix who I was closest to, I expected an emotional catharsis that never came.

One side story I did really like was the landkeepers. It probably has something to do with my politics, but I thought the landkeepers injected the perfect amount of humor while also making some light commentary.

Third, we have the multiplayer aspect. Now multiplayer was not a part of the initial release of this game, but it was the actual hook for me when I voted for it in Indie Game Club. I saw "multiplayer/co-op Pokemon-like" and I got pretty excited. My first hour in the game was with two friends trying out the game together for the first time. We quickly found out that "co-op" was a generous description of the feature. You cannot play the story out with a friend. You each get your own NPC partners. You unlock different parts on the map completely separately and largely cannot interact with the other players. Here's what is synced:
- You can see your friends on the map
- You each see the same beasts in the wild
- You can battle each other and trade
- You can battle rogue fusions (think raids) together

The problem is that the first two bullets are pretty inconsequential and the second two bullets are only interesting later in the game. So starting the game in multiplayer is pretty useless and that experience put a pretty bad taste in my mouth. I kind of wish they stuck with just the second two bullets and made multiplayer a pretty separate section of the game. I think that would have been a more honest representation of the actual feature.

# In Conclusion
The last few sections were a little negative, but I hope I didn't turn you off the game. After I tried the multiplayer, I put the game down for a day, but I quickly found myself wanting to go back. For the next few weeks I was just addicted and wanted to play every night. The combat was fun, the exploration was fun, and putting together my team was fun! The story is enough to keep you interested, especially if you get attached to one or more of the partner characters which is pretty easy to do. Cassette Beasts totally changed my outlook on this type of genre and I would absolutely recommend it to pretty much anyone.
