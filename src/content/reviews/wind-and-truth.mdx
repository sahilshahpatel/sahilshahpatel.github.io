As the final book in the first arc of The Stormlight Archive, I'll put this novel in S tier. It's not necessarily my favorite of the five, but it serves as the culmination of it all, so I'll give it the nod.

One thing I loved about this novel is that it combined both things Sanderson does well: character arcs and lore. The beginning of this book was endlessly interesting because I was finally getting answers to questions I'd had for so long. Learning about the shards, about the Wind, about the Spiritual Realm -- all of it was great. The first Tanavast chapter for me so excited and I kept waiting for the next! Most of all, Szeth's backstory had me completely hooked throughout.

The latter half of the book then had satisfying character arcs. Not everyone will agree with me on this, but Kaladin, Szeth, and Dalinar all had really good arcs in my opinion. Most of all, Adolin, my favorite character, really shone bright in this book.

A few characters were in the middle for me. Shallan was good but not amazing. And Jasnah was super interesting, but it was more the start of an arc than the end. I liked Sigzil's arc a lot to begin with, but him renouncing his oaths so easily mid battle really rubbed me the wrong way, and his end was too open ended for me to really make up my mind.

Navani, Moash, and Gavinor were all left in such limbo that I was a bit disappointed. I suppose their stories will be resumed in the next book, but I was really reading as if it was a final installment. So while I was fine with some obvious loose strings, having absolutely no special final moment for Navani and Moash was surprising. And Gavinor got teased really well, but then not mentioning him all in the falling action felt odd.

Overall though the experience of reading these books with Colin and Zach has been so fun. I've at times felt better or worse about these books. And none of them are individually worth and S tier for me (definitely A+ though), but the cumulative experience of it all is worth and S for sure.
