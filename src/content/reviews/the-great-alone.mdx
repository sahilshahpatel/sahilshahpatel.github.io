Note: I won't leave an excessively long review for this book, as I'm writing it two months after having read it.

The Great Alone is a look into loneliness in it's many forms, whether it's Leni with only one kid her age, Cora who is isolated by her abusive husband, or Ernt who is dealing with PTSD and maybe bipolar disorder and presumably feels that no one can understand him.

Kristin Hannah does a great job of evolving the story over time and attaching you to the main characters. Leni is the only one who gets your full sympathy, by Cora and even Ernt have moments where you feel their pain and hope for the best in their struggles. The Great Alone is a hugely emotional book that doesn't let anyone get out scott free.

I really enjoyed the Great Alone and was consistently excited to come back to it, which is why it easily makes A tier. However, I did find that it's plot was a bit predictable and felt like it was baiting me at points. (SPOILERS) It was just too convenient that just as Cora decides to leave Ernt, they get into an accident and are forced to stay. Leni and Matthew's accident also felt too perfect for the story. And while the end was nice, it made the story feel less real and more "storybook" than the main section of the story did. For that reason, The Great Alone's final rating is an A-.
