I have low expectations for DC movies generally. They have always had a more escapist bent, leaning into the wonder and glory of being a super hero, and that's just never been my preference. So Superman was a movie I was planning on skipping until my friends decided they wanted to go as a group.

Now I might have had a decent experience if I went in blind with only my prejudices about DC in hand. But I was told by one friend that they though the movie was well liked because of its political takes, and that got me a little more interested.

So let's start there. No this movie is not political. At least not in any really important way. Yes, the conflict resembles concerns about Israel/Palestine and Russia/Ukraine. But those are also just the two biggest wars happening right now, so a resemblance is not improbable. The other political comparison is Lex Luthor to Jeff Bezos (or any billionaire really). That's somewhat true, but the similarities there are just because of who Lex Luthor is as a character, and its not like the movie really expands on it in order to say anything other than that ego is bad.

The moments that got the closest to feeling at least character-driven and grounded were in the scenes between Louis and Clark. Those could have gone somewhere, but they were so bare-bones and never expanded on that it didn't really matter. Really this movie had that problem in spades -- it felt like they wrote the story beats down for a Superman movie and then forgot to add in any of the groundwork necessary to flesh it out.

I have to take a quick moment to complain about all the glory shots Superman gets. I get it -- other super heroes are battling the big bads while Superman notices the little girl about to be crushed by the rubble. But do we need to slow-mo that same exact scene like 5 times in the same movie? It was so gratuitous and again the groundwork wasn't there. That moment works in Marvel movies because it's at the climax. It's built up to. It's what we've been waiting for. But in DC they just slot those in anywhere and everywhere and it annoys me endlessly.

The last thing I want to talk about it the very final scene where he changes the "message from his parents" from his birth parents' message to his adoptive parents'. This really bothered me because it had almost nothing to do with the story of the rest of the movie. Clark is shown to always have loved his adoptive parents, so giving them that validation is kind of unnecessary. A friend pointed out to me that this moment could be seen as a rejection of his birth parents. That would be the right intent, but I feel the moment puts the focus much more on appreciating the adoptive parents than it does on rejecting the birth parents. Perhaps that's just my perception, but I had a visceral reaction to that last scene and it left a bad taste in my mouth because it felt so incongruous to me -- like James Gunn did not know what his own movie was about.

Overall Superman is a fine movie. It's entertaining, funny, and it provides a good bit of escapism if that's what you're looking for. Unfortunately, though, I generally don't care about those elements of movies at all. I suspected this movie wasn't going to be for me, and boy was I right.
