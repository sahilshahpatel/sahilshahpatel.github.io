I am writing this review two months after seeing this movie so my memory won't be perfect, but I wanted to record my thoughts.

I was super excited for this movie. I didn't know much, but I saw a preview that showed the art style, and I saw a Japanese director. Somehow I came to believe that this was a Star Wars Visions-like collaboration where a Japanese animation studio was being given a chance to tell a story from the Lord of the Rings universe. That concept sounded so amazing to me, especially because I think LotR is quite well suited to a Ghibli-like story structure.

It was only when I went to the theater and the movie began that I realized how wrong I was. This movie was actually western animation with a very western script. That doesn't automatically spell doom of course, but unfortunately the script animation were also quite poor in my opinion.

First, the animation. The art itself was gorgeous, especially the backgrounds and landscapes. However, the characters' movements were quite weird, especially the arm movements and especially in the early scenes. They felt so unnatural and completely tore me from the movie.

Second, the writing. There was a lot weird about it. **SPOILERS:** The brothers (especially the musical one who is actually close to Hera) were interesting but were just killed off. The old lady in Helm's Deep was completely unnecessary. The story of the old wedding dress was completely irrelevant and only served so that _a_ wedding dress was present at the end and the payoff there was quite bad too. Helm as a ghost was never really explained and didn't make much sense either.

But even more than the weird things that felt like they came from nowhere and went nowhere, there were the very intentional bits that went wrong. Wulf was played as prideful, both in that his father was killed and that Hera rejected him. But it was also implied that his father didn't really get him and that the proposal was his father's idea in the first place. I found that premise quite promising, but later Wulf just becomes an evil guy with none of that nuance anywhere to be found. Meanwhile Hera is supposed to be this independent woman don't need no man character, but she really has very little agency in the story. Her big moment in the end is cool, but her feeling like she needs to wear a wedding dress into battle felt quite random and out of line with what would be realistic. Ultimately the most annoying part is that they use this story as like the reintroduction of feminism back into Rohan, harkening back to the Shield Maidens. But that exact same thing was used with Eowyn in the original movies, and so it feels like Hera's story didn't change anything, either for herself or for her country.

Ultimately this movie was dissapointing on so many levels. I was expecting something super original from a Japanese studio and instead got something quite formulaic. I was expecting a modern feminist female-led story and instead felt that Hera was mostly inconsequential. (Quick aside, but the IMDB description of this film doesn't even mention her character. It says "A sudden attack by Wulf, a clever and traitorous lord of Rohan seeking vengeance for the death of his father, forces Helm Hammerhand, the King of Rohan, and his people to make a daring last stand in the ancient stronghold of the Hornburg.") And I was at least expecting good animation and while the art was fine, the movement really wasn't. All that put together and the movie probably deserves something like a B-, but I feel so betrayed by it that I can only give it a C maximum.
