Down Among the Sticks and Bones is the story of Jack and Jill before the events of [Every Heart a Doorway](every-heart-a-doorway). Just like the first in the series, it's an interesting story and a good read, but it doesn't necessarily have the thematic weight that I wanted out of it. Jack and Jill's story is a good look into bad parenting and poisoned sibling dynamics. It's a look into jealousy and love and the way we adapt to our surroundings. But in the end while it does display those themes through the plot, the end of the story does not in any way solidify those themes or tie the separate themes together satisfyingly. So it's an enjoyable story, but not one that makes the top ranks for me.
