My first internship took place at Nokia on the 5G and Small Cell team, specifically within fault correction. My main project was to use data analytics to identify bottlenecks in the fault correction process. I used Microsoft Power Query M language to calculate statistical metrics about the process and Power BI to create dashboards to display these metrics.

At the time I hadn't studied statistics formally, so there was a lot of learning on the fly, both with the technical tools and the underlying math. A big confidence boost for me was that my manager had a lot of trust in my decision making. I was invited to several meetings where my metrics were used as the starting point for conversations about improving fault correction processes. At the beginning these meetings were extremely helpful because they gave me the necessary context to understand which metrics were truly important. Towards the end, as I began to better understand the company as a whole, I was able to justify my choices well and get the ball rolling towards making a change.

Also during this internship we had an intern robotics challenge which you can read more about [here](/projects/nokia-robotics).
