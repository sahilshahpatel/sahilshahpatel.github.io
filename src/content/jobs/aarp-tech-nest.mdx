My internship at The Tech Nest focused on building a smart-speaker voice application for AARP's [Staying Sharp](https://stayingsharp.aarp.org/) program. During the summer of 2020 I worked there full time, and me and my partner took a set of trivia questions and created a quiz game. Voice applications are tricky because navigating many options quickly becomes annoying. We tackled that challenge through continuous user testing and feedback to refine the layout.

Also during the summer we had a second project: a design thinking challenge with AARP's [Experience Corps](https://www.aarp.org/experience-corps/), a volunteer tutoring group for older adults. Our task was to come up with ways in which the Experience Corps program could better accommodate volunteers with disabilities. We followed a full design thinking paradigm including brainstorming, developing empathy, end-user interviews, and more. In the end we created a set of proposals for the Experience Corps to put into place for the following year.

Finally, I continued part-time with The Tech Nest in the following fall semester. We continued work on the voice application, this time adding integrations with Staying Sharp accounts and other special feature requests.
