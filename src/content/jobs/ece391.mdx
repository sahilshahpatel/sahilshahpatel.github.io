I worked as a TA for ECE 391: Computer Systems Engineering for two semesters in 2021. The class is notorious in our curriculum for being a challenge but I loved it, especially after completing the [final project](/projects/391os). I have always enjoyed the special test of knowledge that is teaching, so I jumped at the opportunity to join the course staff for ECE 391.

The undergraduate TAs for this class are much more involved than in others &mdash; the course is almost entirely project based and that requires a lot of supplemental teaching and support by the TAs in office hours. Taking 391 also taught me to enjoy bug fixing, which is a staple challenge of the course and one students reach out to TAs for help with often.
