After my summer internship at Samsung SARC/ACL I decided to join full time after completing my degree. This time, however, I changed teams to work on Vulkan drivers. I did this because I wanted to try something new, and because Vulkan was something I had never tried but had some interest in after my computer graphics courses at UIUC.

This is my current position, so I will continue to update with details.
