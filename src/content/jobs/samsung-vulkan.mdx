I joined Samsung as a full time employee on the Vulkan driver team. On this team I initially focused on fixing regressions in our driver, ensuring Vulkan CTS conformance.

Next, we shifted towards pre-silicon work. Our processes were not well developed at the time, so I was able to create new processes for bringup on the emulator and also to entirely revitalize our usage of the simulator.

With our processes in place, we began focused on new feature development. I worked on several internal features as well as Vulkan extensions like VK_EXT_host_image_copy. As we became more forward-looking, I also began to attend Khronos meetings to keep our team aware of upcoming plans for Vulkan.

Throughout this process I had a personal focus on improving our debugging processes. I wrote several guides on using debug tools, and fixed our tooling in several places to allow for new debugging workflows that made fixing regressions much easier.
