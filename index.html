                                        <p>
                                            In the summer and fall of 2020, I worked as at The Tech Nest, AARP's prototyping lab. As a student contractor, I was able to work on two projects:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>
                                                    I built a prototype for an Alexa voice application which taught older adults about brain health. After creating
                                                    this proof-of-concept and receiving positive feedback from user testing, we planned to extend the functionality
                                                    by making it compatible with the Google Assistant, among other objectives. I am currently continuing that work part-time.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    I used design thinking principles to advise Experience Corp in how it could be more accomodating to volunteers with
                                                    disabilities. This was a three month process that involved talking with Experience Corp leaders and volunteers to develop
                                                    a good understanding of the present situation, and to develop empathy with those who we were trying to help.

                                        <p>
                                            In the summer of 2019, I had the opportunity to intern at Nokia on the 5G and Small Cells team. Under the guidance of my
                                            mentor, I worked with the fault-correction team on two main projects:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>
                                                    I performed data analysis on fault correction efficiency to try to find the root cause of
                                                    large time-to-closure faults. After processing thousands of unlabeled records, we were able
                                                    to establish some thresholds which generally indicated fault correction issues. However, we
                                                    ultimately decided that the best solution moving forward would be to add a satisfaction label
                                                    to our fault correction records to better enable future data analysis.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    I developed a mobile solution for data access to an on-premise database for Nokia sales representatives.
                                                    Using Microsoft Power BI and Visual Basic scripts, I automated the entire data update and sync processes
                                                    on a virtual machine.

                                During my first semester at Illinois, I took an IEFX (Illinois Engineering First-Year Experience) class which culminated
                                in a trip to Guatemala to build houses for families in need in partnership with <a href = "https://www.theguatemalaproject.org/service-teams/"
                                target = "_blank" class = "blankIcon">the Guatemala Project</a>. During the semester, we learned about engineering ethics
                                and applied it to our own project by investigating Guatemalan culture and how it would impact our goals. Over winter
                                break, our class of 21 students and 2 teachers traveled to Antigua, Guatemala to meet with
                                <a href = "https://www.imagininguatemala.org/" target = "_blank" class = "blankIcon">Imagininguate</a>, sister organization
                                of the Guatemala Project. We stayed with a host family which provided us with a better cultural context for the city as
                                well as great practice with our Spanish! Over the two weeks that we were there, we switched between spending our day at
                                the worksite and going on excursions throughout the city and surrounding area. After five work days, we had built a one-room
                                home with a separate bathroom, outdoor stove, electricity, a window and a door.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The experience taught me a lot about cultural awareness, the value of service, and the power of teamwork. Going in, it felt
                                like there was no way we could really make such a large difference in such a short time. In fact, we didn't know the first
                                thing about building a house before we arrived in Guatemala! But by learning from the Imagininguate workers we were able to
                                contribute meaningfully to the construction. At the end of our trip, we got to watch as the family saw their new house for
                                the first time and give them our well-wishes. As a Spanish-speaker, I didn't need a translator and could to talk straight to
                                them. To be able to communicate the happiness that I felt at that moment in a more personal way brought profound contentment
                                to my heart, and I could see it was reflected in their's as well.

                                I joined SIGGraph my freshman year of college, but it wasn't until my junior year that I was able to take CS 418: Interactive Computer Graphics. In 
                                this class we learned about the graphics pipeline and made many toy examples with WebGL to solidify the concepts taught in lecture. I am especially 
                                proud of the extra-credit project I did: my <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://sahilshahpatel.github.io/CS418/ray-tracer/gpu/">ray-tracer</a>. I initially began writing 
                                it in JavaScript but decided to switch to using OpenGL as a way to better learn WebGL and GLSL (and also to get operator-overloaded vector math!)

                                The coolest part of UIUC's computer engineering curriculum is ECE 391: Computer Systems Engineering. Most of the class is focused on one project 
                                completed in five phases: building our own operating system. Using QEMU for emulation, we write a kernel to interface with hardware. The OS 
                                has a few basic drivers including for the read-only file system, the real-time clock, and the keyboard. The most interesting part of the project 
                                was implementing execute and halt system calls using x86 assembly for context switching. In the course of the project we had to look at a lot of 
                                Intel documentation to understand how to work with the processor on, for example, memory paging. My repository for this project is currently

                                Starting with MechMania 26, I became the Game Engine Lead for the MechMania team. As Engine Lead, I was in charge of the design of
                                our system and organizing the communication between our system, the contestant's code, and our infrastructure. In this year, we decided
                                to try using Google's protocol buffers instead of JSON objects to communicate between our systems. The engine itself was written in Java
                                with multiple HTTP servers for different types of communications, and the contestant starter packs were written in Python and Java, also
                                with an HTTP server to communicate with engine. The game idea for MechMania 26 was a persistent MMO game. The idea of persistence is
                                something MechMania had never attempted before, so it was a great challenge and learning experience to attempt it. The lessons I learned
                                during my first year as Game Engine Lead will help me improve designs for MechMania 27, which is underway.

                                design that we had learned over the semester. My partner and I decided to emulate the game

                                as part of a game jam. This arcade-style game was perfect because it was simple enough to understand, and required minimal game logic (written
                                in C), which allowed us to focus on the graphics accelerator. Because we used the NIOS II/e processor, which is quite slow, trying to write to
                                frame buffers through software would be much too slow. Instead we created hardware modules in System Verilog to control VGA output and to take
                                drawing requests from the software. We used a double-buffered approach with separate controllers for each and a scheduler to switch between the two.

                                I worked on the game engine team for MechMania 25 where we created a strategy-oriented battler designed to be played by AI which the hackathon
                                competitors wrote. Over 24 hours, over 50 competitors in 17 teams developed their own strategies using our starter packs written in Java, Python, and C++. The starter
                                packs abstracted out the HTTP-server-based communication between the game engine and competitor code as well as providing helper functions for
                                path finding and targeting. The game was written to provide a lot of freedom to competitors, including the ability to design their own attack patterns
                                and control of three mechs per match allowing for multiple strategies to be tested at once. The competition ended with a round-robin tournament to decided

                                At Nokia, aside from their work with their mentors, interns compete in a robotics challenge. Using base code written for the BOE Bot (an Arduino-based bot
                                with four wheels and an ultrasonic sensor on a rotating turret), we competed in three separate events. For the first event, we were tasked with
                                navigating through a maze. For the second event, we had to scan the field and park in a spot indicating how many towers there were. For the last event,
                                we had to find two towers and drive a circle around each one. In preparation for the competition, my team first designed algorithmic solutions for each
                                event and then set out to implement them. We learned a lot about the challenges of implementing a theoretical design once real-world errors come into play
                                like wheel slippage and inaccurate sensor readings. Despite these hardships, our team was the only one to have a functioning program for all three events.

                                To earn honors credit for ECE 120 (Introduction to Computing) as part of the James Scholar program, my group and I had to create a project which solved
                                a real-world problem and used logic gates in some capacity. Our idea was to create a dual-method security system with the idea that it could be used on
                                MTD public-transport busses at the university to allow students to get on the bus faster using their i-card for RFID authentication and with a keypad for
                                backup use. To implement the idea, we used an Arduino with the MFRC522 RFID reader, a 3x4 matrix keypad, and an LCD screen. We used the on-board EEPROM of the
                                Arduino to store the valid passcode and RFID tag. A serial comparator (using an XNOR gate and a flip-flop) checked if an inputted passcode/RFID tag was
                                valid and displayed the result on the LCD screen. The full lab report can be found <a href = "files/ECE 120 Honors Lab Report.pdf">here</a>.

                                basic AI and programming decision making. During the competition I created a bot that mimicked a neural network by outputting a decision based on a weighted sum
                                of inputs. Due to a lack of time, we manually adjusted the weights based on our perception of the importance of certain bonuses instead of training the system over time.
                                In the end, we placed 16th out of 36 teams in the rock-paper-scissors style battler.

                                As part of my independent study during my senior year of high school, I decided to try to build a website for our local chapter of the National Honor Society
                                with a friend. At they time, they used Google Docs to keep track of who signed up to volunteer for each event. This was great for looking at records on a per-event
                                basis, but didn't allow students to easily see how many hours they had completed. To us, this sounded like the perfect problem for a relational database. The summer before senior year, we designed the database and a basic
                                web layout. Over the year we wrote the site using PHP with a MySQL database giving students the ability to easily find new events to sign up for, see their history,
                                and more. Administrators could access all student volunteering records and adjust them as needed as well as modify the main page
                                of the site. In the end, the project was not implemented by the school due to upkeep concerns.
                                However, we learned a lot about relational databases as well as cybersecurity by talking with our IT/Systems Manager and performing a security audit on the site.

                                HackRidge 2018 was the first hackathon I ever attended. The scope of the event was very general, so my group and I decided to try to create a recipe recommendation
                                site. Using an API called <a href = "https://www.food2fork.com/about/api" target = "_blank" class = "blankIcon">Food2Fork</a> and taking inspiration from collaborative
                                filtering algorithms used in other recommendation-based services like Netflix and Pandora, we built Foodle. Foodle users could search for recipes and like them, and would
                                recieve recommendations based on what other people who liked similar recipes also liked. Over the 24 hour period of the event, we wrote the backend with PHP and a MySQL
                                database and created a frontend styled with CSS. We were rewarded for our efforts with a first place medal!
