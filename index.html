                        I am currently a Sophomore studying Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
                        I'm involved in multiple <a href = "https://acm.org" target = "_blank">ACM</a> special interests groups including SIGMusic
                        and SIGGraph where I am a co-chair and a project lead respectively. As part of UIUC's 
                        <a href = "https://reflectionsprojections.org" target="_blank">Reflections|Projections conference</a>, I am also the 
                        game engine lead for MechMania, an AI hackathon. My interests are varied and include audio, game development, signal processing,
                        cybersecurity, and machine learning.

                            <p>
                                This past summer I had the opportunity to intern at Nokia on the 5G and Small Cells team. Under the guidance of my
                                mentor, I worked with the fault-correction team on three main projects:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        I performed data analysis on fault correction efficiency to try to find the root cause of
                                        large time-to-closure faults. After processing thousands of unlabeled records, we were able
                                        to establish some thresholds which generally indicated fault correction issues. However, we
                                        ultimately decided that the best solution moving forward would be to add a satisfaction label
                                        to our fault correction records to better enable future data analysis.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        I developed a mobile solution for data access to an on-premise database for Nokia sales representatives.
                                        Using Microsoft Power BI and Visual Basic scripts, I automated the entire data update and sync processes
                                        on a virtual machine.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        I conducted virtual tests for an in-office 4G/5G lab site to assist developers in detecting a bug
                                        which had been reported by customers in the field.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                I worked on the game engine team for MechMania 25 where we created a strategy-oriented battler designed to be played by AI which the hackathon
                                competitors wrote. Over 24 hours, over 50 competitors in 17 teams developed their own strategies using our starter packs written in Java, Python, and C++. The starter
                                packs abstracted out the HTTP-server-based communication between the game engine and competitor code as well as providing helper functions for
                                path finding and targeting. The game was written to provide a lot of freedom to competitors, including the ability to design their own attack patterns
                                and control of three mechs per match allowing for multiple strategies to be tested at once. The competition ended with a round-robin tournament to decided
                                the champion.

                                At Nokia, aside from their work with their mentors, interns compete in a robotics challenge. Using base code written for the BOE Bot (an Arduino-based bot 
                                with four wheels and an ultrasonic sensor on a rotating turret), we competed in three separate events. For the first event, we were tasked with
                                navigating through a maze. For the second event, we had to scan the field and park in a spot indicating how many towers there were. For the last event,
                                we had to find two towers and drive a circle around each one. In preparation for the competition, my team first designed algorithmic solutions for each
                                event and then set out to implement them. We learned a lot about the challenges of implementing a theoretical design once real-world errors come into play
                                like wheel slippage and inaccurate sensor readings. Despite these hardships, our team was the only one to have a functioning program for all three events.

                                To earn honors credit for ECE 120 (Introduction to Computing) as part of the James Scholar program, my group and I had to create a project which solved
                                a real-world problem and used logic gates in some capacity. Our idea was to create a dual-method security system with the idea that it could be used on
                                MTD public-transport busses at the university to allow students to get on the bus faster using their i-card for RFID authentication and with a keypad for
                                backup use. To implement the idea, we used an Arduino with the MFRC522 RFID reader, a 3x4 matrix keypad, and an LCD screen. We used the on-board EEPROM of the
                                Arduino to store the valid passcode and RFID tag. A serial comparator (using an XNOR gate and a flip-flop) checked if an inputted passcode/RFID tag was
                                valid and displayed the result on the LCD screen. The full lab report can be found <a href = "files/ECE 120 Honors Lab Report.pdf">here</a>.
